"The debate over the value of broad knowledge versus specialization is a significant one. I posit that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial than deep specialization in one area. This breadth equips individuals with the tools to navigate a complex and interconnected world.

First, a broad educational foundation allows for greater cognitive agility, enabling individuals to approach problems from multiple perspectives. For instance, a business leader with an understanding of psychology, finance, and global markets is better equipped to make strategic decisions in a complex international business environment.

Second, the ability to integrate knowledge from various disciplines is crucial for innovation. Consider the field of medical technology, where advancements often result from combining insights from biology, engineering, and computer science.

Lastly, a broad knowledge base is essential for civic engagement. Informed citizens who understand the basics of science, politics, and culture are better equipped to participate in democratic processes and contribute to the common good.

In sum, the pursuit of broad academic knowledge is not only intellectually rewarding but also practical, fostering a more adaptable and innovative mindset that is crucial for success in the modern world.",P1,CHI,high,1
"The debate over the merits of broad academic knowledge versus specialization is a significant one. I maintain that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous than focusing on one specific subject. This broad knowledge base is essential for fostering innovation and adaptability in an ever-changing world.

First, a broad academic background encourages the cross-pollination of ideas, leading to more creative and effective problem-solving. For example, the integration of concepts from psychology and economics has given rise to behavioral economics, which has transformed our understanding of consumer behavior.

Second, the versatility provided by a broad education is a significant asset in a dynamic job market. A professional with knowledge in diverse fields such as computer science, literature, and philosophy is better equipped to adapt to new roles and industries.

Finally, a broad knowledge base contributes to a more informed and engaged citizenry. Understanding the basics of science, politics, and the arts enables individuals to participate more fully in societal debates and make more informed decisions.

In summary, the pursuit of broad knowledge across multiple academic subjects is a wise strategy for those seeking to remain adaptable and innovative in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.",P1,CHI,high,1
"The importance of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects as opposed to specializing in one specific subject cannot be overstated. I firmly advocate for the former, as it prepares individuals for a world that values adaptability and interdisciplinary understanding.

First, a broad academic background allows for the synthesis of ideas across different fields, leading to more innovative and comprehensive solutions to problems. For instance, understanding both environmental science and public policy is crucial for creating effective strategies to combat climate change.

Second, the ability to draw from a wide range of knowledge can be a significant asset in the workplace. Professionals who can understand and communicate across disciplines are often more effective collaborators and leaders. A manager with a grasp of economics, technology, and human resources is more likely to lead a team to success than one with a narrow focus.

Finally, a broad education supports cultural literacy and empathy. By learning about a variety of subjects, individuals gain insights into different ways of thinking and living, which is invaluable in our diverse and interconnected world.

In sum, the pursuit of broad knowledge across many academic subjects is a wise investment in one's intellectual and professional future, providing a foundation for lifelong learning and success.",P1,CHI,high,1
"In the ongoing discourse on educational breadth versus depth, I assert that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is preferable to specializing in one specific subject. This breadth equips individuals with a versatile toolkit for navigating the complexities of contemporary life and for excelling in various professional contexts.

Firstly, possessing a broad knowledge base enhances cognitive flexibility, enabling individuals to think critically and creatively. For example, a background in both history and computer science can provide unique insights into the development of digital humanities, a field that leverages technology to explore historical contexts.

Secondly, the versatility gained from a broad education is invaluable in today's fast-paced and ever-changing job market. A professional with a diverse educational background can pivot between different roles and industries with ease. For instance, a background in both engineering and business can open doors to opportunities in technical management or entrepreneurship.

Lastly, a broad knowledge base fosters a more comprehensive worldview, allowing individuals to understand and appreciate the interconnectedness of global issues. This understanding is crucial for effective participation in an increasingly globalized society.

"Personally , I totally agree with that we should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .

First of all , in fact , no matter closely or less closely , every subject is interrelated with each other .
We need broad knowledge of many academic subjects even we are majoring in a specific subject .
If we focus on one thing , failing to possess a wide span of knowledge of related subjects , we are even unable to be excellent in this given field .
For example , if we study physics , of course , we need to pay much attention on our physics books and remember all the complex rules .
But that is not all !
We need other kinds of knowledge to help us doing the physics studies .
We need to know about computer , which will help us with our researches ; we may need to know about English , in order to visit the foreign websites to see the latest developments in physics all over the world ; we may also need to know about lecturing , in order to spread our ideas or new discoveries .

Second , without the broad knowledge of many academic subject , we are unlikely to live an enjoyable life in today 's changing and integrited world .
Nowadays , the world has become more and more mixed , no matter in geographical sense or in cultural and academical sense .
We make friends with people from all over the world and we are no longer refrained within our little circles .
Our friends may be just specialized in totally different subjects or fields .
It is just unrealistic if we remain only familiar with solely one kind of knowledge .
So , in order to communicate with all kinds of friends and to boost interpersonal relationship , we must broaden our scope of knowledge .
Only by doing this could it be possible for us to lead an enjoyable and rewarding life in today 's world .

So , in a word , I think that it is high time we stressed on the importance of accumulating knowledge of many academic subjects .

"In a modern society , people always face the dilemma of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than having specialized knowledge in one specific subject .
This question is such a much-debated one that it affects almost everyone in his or her daily life and deserves some close examinations .
As far as I am concerned , I vote for the former , which means I do agree with this statement .
Among various reasons that support my choice stance is that having broad knowledge can make you more attractive , can provide more oppotunities for you career , and can make your life more interesting .

Basic to any understanding of reason preferring having broad knowledge is that it can make you more attractive .
If you are knowledgeable in many academic subjects , you can share more information with your friends and people arrounding you .
For instance , I have a friend who has deep understanding in many fields , such as history , mathematics , music , and even cooking .
I like talking to him , because I can learn much from him .
That 's why , in my opinion , broad knowledge can make one attractive .

Moreover , having broad knowledge can provide more oppotunities for you career .
You have more choices .
A persuasive example is that one of classmates has got an exellent job besides her major .
She has both strong knowledge in both industrial engineering , which is her major , and software designing .
Eventually , she got the job as a programmer , which provides a decent salary .
We are all admire her now .
Therefore , if you have broad knowledge , you have more oppotunities for you career .
Furthermore , you can live better based on the broad knowledge .

Besides , the further reason , not the last , why argee with this statement is that it can make your life more interesting .
In fact , my father is just the person who has broad knowledge .
In his spare time , he play tennis , translate Germany literatures , and design mechanical equipment .
His life is colorful .
As a proverb says , `` Various knowledage can make a person rich . ''
In today 's world , having broad knowledge does give you incredible experiences and make you a rich mind person .
It is obviously that only these three reasons can make everyone draw the conclusion that , not to mention there are more reasons that account for my propensity for it .

In summary , from what we have discussed above , we can safely come to the conclusion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and I agree with this statement .
Anyway , it is confined to me ; different persons may have different choices accroding to their own personalities and fondness .

"`` Knowledge is power '' , we would definitely agree that the more knowledge people have , the greater achievements they will accomplish .
However , as one 's life time is limited , he/she is always faced with the choice of studing broad knowledge of many academic subjedts and specializing in one specific subject .
As a graduate student , having a broad knowledge of various subjects is a wise choice for me .

First of all , the world is ever changing and as an undergraduate student , I cannot definitely decide what occupation I will take after my graduation .
I can not specialize in on specific subject too early because doing so will certainly constrain my career development .
Suppose I have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , I would definitely have a greater chance to choose my potential occupation ; on the contrast , if my knowledge is too specialized , my choice will be limited .

Secondly , the society calls for person with comprehensive knowledge .
For example , a business firm come to my school recruiting employees .
The students the favor is those business school students with engineering backgrounds .
They think those people can have a more prosperous career future .
This is not a rare case , for the compitition in society is getting more and more fierce , so a person with comprehensive knowledge has more chance to succeed .
And having broad knowledge of many academic subjects surly does good to this .

Besices , studing broad knowledge of various subjectsj helps to foster one 's interest .
By reading books of different fields , you can experience different ways of thinking and find your interest ; while concentrate on one specific subject provides you with less chances to experience different topics .

Though a person should be specialized in one specific subject for survival because only having broad knowledge does not help you stand out among others , studying broad knowledge of various academic subjects is a wise choice for an undergraduate student .

"There is a controversial issue about whether students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject .
Depending on their distinct backgrounds and experiences , different students hold different opinions .
In my point of view , I think a specific learning is better because it is more dominated in a person 's career .

The most impornt reason of choosing a specialized knowledge is that nowadays the knowledge in every subject is becoming more and more difficult .
On one side , as the sciense and technology develops , the knowledge of one specific subject becomes more complicated .
On the other side , a person 's energy is limits by the nature .
Thus , if a person insists on learn a broad range of subjuects , he will find that he is left behind the other persons more and more .
For example , one of my classmates , who liked to learn lots of different subjects , such as mathematics , biology and arts , got a bad GPA during his college career .
Therefore , we should not expect us to be a perfect person who knows everything .
A good example , Bill Gates , the richest man in the world , may lose the match to a pupil in playing ping-pong .
So becoming a person who is expert in one area is more reasonable .

Another important reason is that the current society need more and more specific-trained persons , such as IT enigeers , doctors , professional player and so on .
Today works can no more be classified to several types , they are elaborated to very specific jobs .
For example , the computer companies have been divided to sofeware companies such as Microsoft , hardware companies such as Intel .
Moreover , new types of companies are also appearing , such as internet companies , Goole .
These different jobs need more and more knowledge in specified area and a narrower knowledge range compared to the past .
Thus a specific-trained person is obviously more suitable than a widely-trained person .

To be fair , I must own up to the importance of the elementary knowledge in a wide range .
Everyone should learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects in his/her junior and senior school to detemine what he/she is suitable for .
However , this broading learning is just preparing for the later deeper specialized learning which is longer and more important in one 's career .

To sum up , due to the reasons mentioned above , we can safely draw the conclusion that students should specialize in one specific subject .

"To be a broad-knowledge person or to be a specialized person depends on a case-by-case analysis .
When one wants to be a leader , it is better to manage as much and as broad as knowledge , while if one tends to be a technician , specialized knowledge is a better choice .

Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects means a person holding variety of capabilities .
Thus leaders always need such ability .
Take the president , who is the leader of a country for example , such person always holds knowledge in many realms , from politics of course , to economics , laws , management , perhaps history , psychology and so forth .
Since with such broad knowledge , one can understand how the society is formed and know a lot about the world .
The most famous person of such kind is Aristole .
The broad reading and studying enable him to manage most of the subjects and to be a wise man .

On the other hand , since most of people who have broad knowledge often cannot specialize on any subject , our sociey also needs the person who has specialized knowledge .
In many industries , specialized person is more welcomed .
For example , in stock market , the person who specializes on stock or finance is preferable ; in companies like Dell or Microsoft , students who major in computer or computer science will be chosen ; also in some scientific research areas , having specialized knowledge will benefit the person a lot .
In one word , if one wants to work in specific area , it is bettere to manage specialized knowledge .

From the analysis above , it can be easily concluded that whether to have broad knowledge or one specific subject knowledge depends on the interet of a person .
From my point of view , I prefer to manage deeply on one specific subject and broad learning knowledge on other areas .
From doing that , I can be a person with broad knowledge which may do good when I make friends since they may come from different subjects of knowledge .
Also , with the knowledge of a specific area especially what I am most interested in , I can have a specific skill which will do favor when I apply for a job .

In conclusion , the choices between these two rely on a person 's own plan for the life .
To me , the combination of them is the best solution .

"Would you like to study broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject ?
I believe different people have different answers .
However , I prefer to study broad knowledge for several reasons below .

First , in fact , many students do not konw what they are really interested in .
As we know , nowadays , many students have a same problem that they do not like their majors .
Why dose this problem happen ?
I believe that it is resulted from that they are not interested in their majors .
If they can study broad knowledge of many academic subjects , they would find out that what they are really interested in .
This is very important .
Actually , I have this problems , too .
My major is material science .
And I can not study other subjects in my university .
However , i do not like my major , because I can not find out any interesting things from this major .
Every day I have to do experiments in my lab , which is boring .
In fact , I want to learn some subjects that I could communicate with other people .
I believe if I have another choice , I would not choose this major again .
As a result , I choose another major when I study for my mater degree now .

Second , in modern society , most of jobs require students have many skills , instead of a certain skill .
As we know , when people work in a company , he has to know how to use computer , because today most of works are finished on computers , and the communication with other thoughout Emails or MSN also need to be done on computers .
If this person only know about his major , such mathmetic , arts , or something else , I do not believe that he would have a capability for this work .
That is to say , he would be fired in future .
I believe this is a pity for our education in universites .
Consequently , we should learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects to fillful the various requirement of many jobs .
If we have kinds of knowledge , we could do many jobs in a company , and we have more chances to get promotoed .
for example , if we learn knowledge about engeering and management in university , we could apply for two types of jobs in a company , which would be very useful for our career in the future .

However , to learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects does mean that it is unnecessary to specialize in one specific subject .
What I mean is that we should also be professional experts , because when we face with some difficulties in our work , we must have academic knowledge to address them .
This is of great essence to us .
In sum , we should learn broad knowledge in the first place , and then we also have to specialize in one specific subject .

"It is always a controvertial issue over whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to speciallize in one specific subject .
In my opinion , I prefer to be a specialist in one academic field during my university life .

One main factor is the limited time .
In my country , our college eduction lasts 4 years .
During that time , you should not only do your studying but take part in some extra-curriculum activities as well in order to get a good job in the future .
Therefore , it is impossible for a student with an average intellect to learn all the knowledge of every subject in such a short time .

Another factor is that the energy of every people is limited .
You could n't expect the people to sleep less than 4 hours in order to be a generalist .
Also , it is a truth the some people only are suitable to some certain subjects .
If you force them to learn what they are not good at , it 's just a way of wasting their energy .

Last but not least , the purpose of school to educate the people is to serve the society .
That is to say our education should meet the demands of the current society .
What is the rightnow situation ?
Thanks to the developed economy and stable world enviroment , the quantity of the labour forces is not the problem .
What we want now is the improvement of the quality of the labour forces .
That means our society needs the people with a strong background of one certain area instead of those who know only a little about everything .

Admittedly , broad education is very important in today 's education so as to help develope a student properly .
But that does n't to say we should put all our limited time and energy into learning everything .
With the structure of the labor forces becoming more and more reasonable , I believe those who is a master of a certain area will have a promising future .

"From my point of view , I agree with the statement that it would be better for a student to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject only .
I will explain it from three aspects , personal interest , personal development and vanishing subject .

Firstly , not much students can realize their interest that which subject they like most .
Many of them , including me would get frustrated when we should make a choice among thousands of subjects to study in university .
However , if we no need to choose a specific one to concentrate on , we can expose to different kinds of subjects and hence develop our interest .
It is really regrettable if we make a wrong decision is choosing it .

Secondly , broad education can nurture students to be an all-rounder .
All companies demand all-rounders instead of students with specific knowledge .
Of course , everyone should have his/her strengths and weaknesses .
However , broad education allows students to develop more comprehensively .
For example , the art students may be weak in communication skills or the science students may be too rational .
But if all students are put together and study more subjects , a student 's personality may have influence on the others besides gaining other subjects ' knowledge .

Last but not least , it prevents some subjects to be vanished or even disappeared .
Sometimes , students choose subjects that have good future career such as business .
Few people would choose subjects just based on interest .
Therefore , this leaves some subjects like Chinese history to become vanished .
But Chinese history actually is worth studying and important for young people to familar .
At this point , if we set broad knowledge is a must , the problem wo n't happen .

In conclusion , studying in many subjects is better than specialize in one as it allows students to develop more interest , to become all-rounded that can benefit their future career and also prevent some subjects from vanishing .

Some may frown to it , because they think if they specialize in one specific subject , they can achieve more success , .
While others may say yes , since they perfer to contact with all kinds of knowledge .
When it comes to me , I tend to agree with the second opinion , that is , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

To start with , broad knowledge is quite essential in social communication .
There is no denying that human are social beings , we need to communicate with others .
But it takes all sorts to make a world , some are teachers , some are doctors , and others may be scientists .
If we have no knowledge of other fields except your own learning area , it can be quite different to makes friends with them .
You may even do not know how to start a conversation , it can be quite frustrated .

Besides communication , there is another important point .
In certain times , some knowledge in other area is needed in our daily life .
Last summer , I went to a small town near the ocean with several friends .
We was deeply moved by the beautiful scenery there , the beach is always full of sunshine .
We loved to relax ourselves on the beach when the sun is setting sun , the breeze is blowing and seabirds are singing .
We went to a seafood restaurant nearby , the seafood there can be the best in the world .
But at this time , my friend felt quite uncomfortable .
At first all of us did not know what was wrong , suddenly I reminded a medcine book I have read before .
I happened to know that he seemed to be allergetic to this kind of seafood .
So I went to the clinic and bought the right medcine for him .
You see , sometimes these knowledge can be quite useful

`` It is always benefical to open a book '' as the old saying says , similarly , it is always benefical to gain knowledge , it can help us to know more about ourselves as well as this world .
So that this plant will be a better place to live in .

Further more , possessing a broad knowledge in different areas could make you cultivate new interest in different fiels and give you more perspectives to look at your surrounding world .

I am a man with a strong desire for achievement and always want to possess more knowledge about the world which would challenge myslfe and make me a useful people needed by my society. a wide knoledge in lots of aspects enable me to seek success in more areas rather that a narrow one .

So if you want gain a successful career , you 'd better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Car industry set an goog example for my opinion .
To make you company earn more profits , only imroving the technology is not enough .
It is true that people prefer the car that has better quality , good design , and lower cost .
And also technology can fulfill these target .
But after you producing such a good car , the really more significant thing is how to sell it or how to occupy more market , which need the theory and knowledge of enterprise management .
You should have a acute sense of what your potential consumer is need , what they think the car should be , and the most important factor that can determine how well your car 's selling is how much they can afford .
Without all of these useful knowledge , I mean what in different fields , the company will lose their customer , then lose their market and finally close down .

Service industry is another exaple that indicates what I have asserted .
Many people think that the only skill that a waiter or some other people who provide service is being good at making their customers or clients feel comfortable and satisfied .
However , it is not the case .
The fact is these people also need some necessary knowledge to cater to different taste of different people .
For instance , the receptionist who work in an international hotel .
Firstly , they need know how to serve customers .
They can learn from the books which contain different customer , different culture and suitable manners .
They also should master at least foreign language to make they can communicate people who speak different language .
If they can not , they may lose their job .

"Whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or being specialized in one specific subject also benefits the society .
The society requires both types of scholars to develop smoothly .
I think that being broadly trained and specialized also depends on the personnal ability .
What level you are educating is additionally a concerning issue for such consideration .

Our society needs specialists such as engineers and doctors as well as broad trained people , politicans for instance .
All of them have their special roles in the society and the society would become choatic without either of them .
Of course engineers and doctors could only be specialized in one subject as they are the experts in their fields and they should then spend all of their time on their specialized subjects .
However , for politicans , many of them are rather broadly trained in several subjects including economics , history and languages so that they would be able to know what the residents want and how to promote the policy .

A second crition on being specialized or not is depending on the personnal ability .
Some people are gifted in certain abilities they should then being specialized while some people learn several different things very quickly , they might then be broadly trained in various academic subjects .
Education and learning would be a funny process if you realize what your strengths are .

Moreover , the last but the most important reason for choosing between having broad knowledge or being specialized in one subject is what are your educating level .
If you are the primary and secondary school students , you should probably have broad knowledge instead .
A good basic knowledge in every academic subjects is essential for the choosing what subjects you would be learned deeply in the future .
You could not choose your right subjects if you do not have any knowledge in it .
Also much knowledge is based on the same basis and theory such as physics is sticked to mathematics , you could not then learn physics without knowing any mathematic equations .
If you are a college or postgraduate students , you might be specialized then .
As time is limited but knowledge is unlimited , you could not thus learn everything else in depth in such a limiting time .

Therefore there is not absolutely good to choose having broad knowledge of different academic subjects or specializing in one certain subjects , it all depends on the above critia .

"Glance through a piece of newspapers and you will in all likelikhood see news concerned with the future trends of such careers as accountants , lawyers , doctors , and so on .
There has long been a controversy about whether a person coped with broad knowledge will be superior to the one with only specialized knowledge in one academic aspect .
Actually , this is an issue regarding to the `` width '' and `` depth '' of knowledge acquired .
To me , however , I contend that it is the depth of the knowledge that prevail .
This argument can be ascribed to the following rationales .

To commence with , acquiring specialized knowledge can have a person comprehensively and deeply understand the academic subject specialized .
True , someone may claim that a person should receive general education to be comprehensive for knowledge .
However , imagine if a person acquire all breeds of knowledge in different aspects but without further deep understanding of them .
Do you think if he really understands the core knowledge of every aspects ?
In contrast , a person acquiring a specialized knowledge in his education can let him stand out among others .
And a specialized person can receive general knowledge through reading books and newspapers .

Second , from a career perspective , possessing specialized knowledge can serve as an entry barrier for the industry that requires the specific knowledge .
A vivid example of this is the accounting industry .
To successfully become an accountant or auditor , one must have possessed much expertise pertaining to accouting standards and rules .
How can a person who has much knowledge in the sense of width but without the depth compete for the job ?
So it is undeniably true that having specialized knowledge can render a person competent enough for his career .

Last but by no means least , viewed from a macroeconomic sense , having people specializing knowledge in various academic subjects can serve as a divison of labor of an economy .
When people in an economy posseess different kinds of expertise , comparative advantages are thus created and the economy can have a pool of talents on different aspects .
To further support this point , think of an extreme situation when an unprecedentedly new leathal disease is spread out in a country .
If everyone does have a knowledge broadly but witout depth , who can help tackling the problem which require strong knowledge in , for example , bio-chemistry ?

In recapitulation , a person possessing specialized knowledge can be benefical for both individuals and the society .
I , therefore , stand against the statement in the question .

"I think that it depends on what is the field of the academic subjects you are studying .
If the acadmic subjects is about science or other similar subjects which need some professional knowledge , that will need to specialize in the specific subject .

In my concentration , education , I think I need the broad knowledge of academic subjects .

To have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects is very important in studying education .
Teaching has a lot of works to do .
If you want to make the learner understand what you are talking about , you will need to explain .
But if you know less , how can you make your learner understand what you want to talk about ?
The only way to solve the problem is to try to explain in many different ways untill your learner can know what you are talking about .
That is why you need to have broad knowledge .
Because when you know more , you can teach more and you can make more people understand what you want to talk about .

In other hand , if your subject is in those subjects which needs professional knowledge , it is better to speclialize in one specific subject .
Take science as an example : if you are studying the molecular biology , you needs many professional knowledge about biochemistry or molecular biology .
If you can know more , you will study more .
That will need more specific knowledge to make you learn more .
That is the reason you need to keep on studying specific knowledge .

To get the conclusion , my opinion of this topic is that it depends on what kind of subject you are studying .
If the subject you are studying needs to explain or combine other knowledge , you will need to learn more from other subjects .
But if your subject needs the professional knowledge , you would better to keep on studying more in your specific knowledge .
That is the only way to help to learn more and better .

However , when it comes to education , it will be a bad idea for the students nowadays .
For example , I 've always wanted to be an simultaneous interpreter .
But being an interpreter requires a lot more than the knowledge about translating .
He has to know `` something about everything , and everything about something '' .
If he has to go to a conference which is dicussing the oil crisis .
He has to know the basic information about oil , all kinds of oil in fact .
Therefore , a successful professional should n't be limited in the arena of his specialized subject .
Otherwise , his success would n't last very long .
For example , if you are an employee working for an insurance company .
The basic rule for you to success is that you know how to sell .
That is a skill that involves with a lot of other subjects .
You 'd better know how the hospital works , so that you can sell your insurance to its patiences .
Then you need to know what kind of patients can make protential customers and what kind of patients can not ( like those who have developed uncurable disease ) .
So , after years of studing in college , if you know nothing other than what insurance is , you are definitely doomed .

So , in my opinion , being an `` expert '' is not a bad thing , but what we really need in today 's challenging world are people who have their specialization and also the broad knowledge about the nature and the society .

"Many people believe that succeeding in a specific subject will result to the success in one 's career .
This is not the case , however .
I believe it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects to succeed in life .
Knowledge is crucial , so knowing more is always better .
Examples of my opinion can be found in everyday situations .

First of all , in school , all-round students get better grades overall than students who do well in one subject and not so well in the rest .
In fact , schools promote that students should be aware of all subjects .
The students will then use the concepts they learn in school for real-life purposes .
Gaining more knowledge from different academic subjects results in a better understanding of different perspectives .

For example , if a student plans to go into business , he or she must learn the mandatory courses such as marketing and economics .
However , mastering in those courses does not guarantee that the student will become a successful businessman or businesswoman .
If the student has a broad knowledge of other academic subjects such as psychology or mathematics , he or she will know more about why a business succeeds or not and how to prevent a business from failing .
Though these courses are very different , knowing the general concepts will aid the student as it gives him or her different approaches and perspectives .

Another example is if a student wants to become a doctor .
Finishing medical school is just one step in becoming successful .
If the student does n't know the basic concepts of how to set up a clinic , then how will he or she perform his or her practices ?
Again , business and medicine are very different subjects , but knowing both results to better success .

In conclusion , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .
Students are lucky to study many subjects in school because not only will they be aware of more perspectives , they can utilize all concepts in real life situations .
More knowledge leads to more success .

"Some people claim that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
However , I hold a opposing view due to the following resons :

First , gaining in-deth knowledge on many academic subjects would be extremely time consuming .
Studying many different kind of subjects requires the students to spend a lot of time and effort in it .
In this way , the students can only learn some superficial knowledge about each subjects but cannot really have a very in-depth understandings of the subjects .
On the other hand , studying one specific subject can allow you to specialize in it and acquire thorough and in-depth knowledge about the subject .

In addition , many careers are specialists and thus require the specific knowledge of that particular subject .
For example , being a lawyer you need to have specific knowledge about the law terms , the judiciary system and the judiciary situation of the place you want to work in .
You can not enter those specific careers unless you specialize and acquire in-depth knowlegde about that academic subject .

Last but not least , having specialized in one specific subject can offer you chance to investigate the field which is not touched by people before .
You can hardly discover new things or findings in your study unless you have in-death and specific knowledge in that particular subject .
For example , if you want to pose a revolution in astronomy study , you need to specialize yourself in it , spending lots of time and efforts in it or else it would be impossible for you to make any revolutionary findings .
One can see that the previous scientists who triggered off scientific revolution are those who spent their life time in the study of science .

To conclude , I believe that specialization in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge on many different subjects but with superficial knowledges only .

"People have different dreams and goals .
Some desire to be a journalist , while some set themselves the goal of becoming a scientist .
Different dreams and goals decide if it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject .
For a person who wants to be an expert in a speical field such as in bio-chemistry , it 's better to be specialize in his/her own specific subject .
However , for the general public , I deem it better to have a broad range of knowledge of many academic subjects .

Firstly , acquiring a broad knowledge of many subjects means bigger and better prospects of employment .
For example , if a person has a broad range of knowledge , he/she can apply to a variety of job positions and have the chance to choose from the job offers avaible and take the best one .
Whereas a person specializing in just one subject is confined to job opportunities in only that particular field .

Secondly , people with a broad knowledge can work more efficiently .
Lots of knowledge are inter-related .
You never know when you are going to need the knowledge in one field to help work in another field .
This is particularly true in the profession of journalists .
If a reporter only has knowledge in bio-science , what if he/she is assigned to cover a story about GDP growth ?
An all-round knowledge is needed here to ensure the reporter to accomplish his/her task .

Thirdly , people with a broad knowledge can enjoy better social relationship and win more respects .
People will enjoy talking to them because they can always provide reliable and interesting information on whatever topic is engaged .

"I agree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Having knowledge in a broad number of academic subject not only constitues an all rounded person , but also paves the way for the success in specializing in one specific subject .

To acquire a truly thorough understanding of a specific subject , the knowledge of that subject alone is not enough .
It is in conjuction with other subjects that gives academics a greater understanding of what they are currently dealing with .
If one only focuses one 's studies in a specific subject , their method of thought would only be limited to that particular subject .
For example , a mathematician might only be familiar with the methological deduction of a problem , and hence be unable to understand matters with an imaginative mind .
Should the mathematician develop his mind in different ways , say through art or writing , he might be able to develop mathematics further .
For example , the Klein 's bottle , named ( not suprisingly ) after Klein is a mathematical concept which is not applicable in the real world .
Yet it has been and still is an important mathematical concept and puzzle which forms the bases of further mathematical investigation .
If mathematicians follow a logical and structural line of thought , the Klein 's bottle would have never been thought of and mathematics would not be able to further itself .

Furthermore , take philosophy for example , it has become apparent that to become a successful philosopher , one must acquire skills from various subjects .
Kant and Heidegger amongst other prominent philosophers have had their say on the subject .
They believe in order to become a successful philosopher , one must acquire skills from mathematics and science , an ability or a means to comprehend the world , a method of logical mental training that is crucial to the functioning of a clear-minded philosopher .

Given the proliferation of academic institutions that faciliate research and learning in all sorts of areas , each discipline is slowly beginning to exhaust itself in its subject matters .
Also , the technological advancements have lead us to be living in an ever changing environment , resulting in many new inter-disciplinary connections .
For example , even the development of a robot dog takes into account the psychological effects it will have on humans , and creates a more acceptable model .
( Hence the connection between the engineering and psychology ) .
With the above two reasons , it is even more crucial that in order to truly succeed at ` specializing ' in one subject , not only does on need to delve into the contents of it , but also in other academic subjects .

"When facing the question of whether to grasp more than one specific subject , people always are divided into two group , one of which agrees to learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects , however , the other of which belives that we should concentrate on one specific subject .
In my opinion , mastering broad knowledge is the better choice .
My reasons are presented as follows .

First , learning various knowledge is beneficial to an individual in modern society .
Now we live in a changeable world , in which technology rapidly is developed .
This change generates the changes of our life style .
For example , computer has entered our normal life and we hardly work without it .
But some years ago , people did not know what it was .
If we just stay on one specific subject and fail to learn knowledge about computers , how can we live normally in this society .
So , the current society situation requires us to grasp many useful knowlege of different subjects and keep to refreshing them .

Second , people that own broad knowledges always look smart because they may be enlightened by another subject knowledge .
Holding different knowledges can enhance the thinking ability and raise the ways in which people think and act .
When a person encouters a big difficulty on a subject , he may obtain some inspiration one day through focusing on another subject that he/she conducts .

Admittedly , focusing on one specific subject may cause someone to research more deeply than dispersing one 's concentrations on various subjects .
Of course , researchers should pay their attention on the specific subject .
But , rearchers still learn other subjects that are useful in their lives .

In all , comparing the advantages and disadvantages between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and just having one specific academic one , I support my idea that people should learn various subjects knowledges rather than own one .

"Some people hold that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
As far as I am concerned , I 'd like to take a neutral stand on this issue .
My opinions go as follows .

In the first place , with no doubts , the society aspires talents who have comprehensive knowledge of many academic subjects .
For instance , in some companies , a secretary is expected to perform not only in administration , but also in related areas such as banking , accounting , marketing and HR .
Nowadays it 's not uncommon that more and more companies , in order to acquire more profits , often cut back costs on the number of staff .
Making one staff do the work of two or even three is not unusual .
Employees at work are expected to be equipped with broad knowledge , so that they can perform in all areas .
As we all know that to do well at work , you have to be an all-rounder .
Many people have been aware that language command and computer skills all have become common tools , all modern people need to know how to use a computer .
We have to admit that a lawyer who could speak English and has good computer knowledge can do better than his or her counterpart who does not speak a foreign language .

However , in certain fields , people need to be specialized in one specific subject .
This is especially true in science and technology field .
To do well in a certain field , people have to be specialized in it .
especially those students who take doctorate degrees , some are specifically in Glass , some in Optic Fibre .
In my opinion , even an accountant can do very well if he or she gets only specialized in accounting .

"The issue whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject is a controversial one .
On the one hand , some people believe that we can experience the different interesting of many academic subjects .
On the other hand , others believe that we have to learn things more specific then we can train the ability of concentrating on things easily .
As far as I am concerned , I prefer to study broad knowledge of many academic subjuects .
In addition , I will argue over the issue in the following reasons .

The first reason for my belief is that we can learn more and apply the subjects more .
In other words , in such busy and competitive world , we cannot close ourselves in just single subject or specific knowledge .
Furthermore , we ought to open our mind and eyes to experience new fields .
For example , I have studied child education for several years and I teach in elementary school right now .
However , I deeply consider that I face too much other difficulties that I have never met before or studed before such as how to connect with their parents effectively or how to reduce my personal anger when I come in class .
Therefore , as long as I teach , I think I have a lot of things or subjects I need to study .
Hence , I come back to school and start to learn other academic subjects .

The second reason for my belief is that I can make other frinds in different areas .
As matter of fact , we have less chance to meet other people that do not study the same class .
I mean we all consider the whole thing in the single opinion that we stand .
Therefore , we have to widen our mind and reopen it to other areas and make some differents friends and maybe sometimes they can give us other aspects ideas .
For instance , I like to play piano and I have learned it for many years .
One day my friend told me that why do n't we coperate with each other .
He is good at dancing .
When we conbine our idea together , we find it very interesting .

To sum up , I firmly believe that we must have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because we have to live in the competitive world and you do not believe that how beautiful that we can spark out .
In the end , I will conclude the issue by emphasizing that not only do we consistantly study different subjects but also we encourage others to do so .

"After pondering this question thoroughly and prudently , I finally reach the point that it depends .
If a student wants to go directly into the workforce after graduation , it 's may better for him to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
On the other hand , if another student wants to become a specialist in a given domain , I think he 'd better specialize in that one specific subject .

Nowadays the number of college students who hunt for a job just after graduation keeps increasing .
Mainly because they are aware of that different job require different knowledge or skills .
Some jobs require a student can use a computer fluently and skillful , some may hope a student to be capable to speak different kind of lauguages , and some others may just use those whose have the intensive ability of coorporation and sccialization .
To mee to various requirement of jobs , students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Take my sister for example .
Before graduation , she did n't know what job exactly she wanted to pursue .
But since she had broad knowledge gained from many subjects in college .
She sent innumerable applications to very diverse companys .
Guess what ?
All of those companys said OK to her .
And then she could choose the best one from them .

But if a student , like me , dreams of becoming a specialist or even a scientist in a certain realm , he should and must specialize in that one specific subject .
The foremost reason why I said that is , only this way , can a student make great consentrate on that one subject and learn more about it .
Like me , I always think I will becom a specialist in EE , so , now I put all of my focus and energy on that subject .
By doing more research and reading more refference book of that subject , I obtained a profound understanding about it .
Although I ca n't assert that I am a master today in EE , I have took the most significant step to be a master I think .

Taking into account of all that mentioned above , I draw the conclution that this question depends .

"I agree with the statement , partly .
Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is great , but focus on a specific subject is also very good .
I think it depends on your age and your position in the company .

When we are in the middle schools , it is better to have broad knowledge .
A teenager do n't know exactly what they want .
They may be eager to become a famous singer in the moring , and carzy about the idea of being a scientist in the midnight because of a sweet dream .
And everyone 's interest may change in the long run .
When I loved the computer games in my 14 years old , I wanted to be a game designer .
In every dream of mine , I studied computer science in a famous high school .
I attained the Blizzard Entertainmet Company ( The most famous company which presents pc-games ) .
I was the only focus in the E3 ( the greatest pc-games conference ) .
But now , I lost my interest in pc-games .
Being a doctor is more attrative to me .
If I put all my passion on computer and gave up my schoolwork , no doubt I was regrating for that .

But when we are in univercities , we should choose a subject to study .
Today , no one can handle all knowledge .
Everybody should know something deeply and corporate with others .
As old chinese saying goes : `` You know everything , you know nothing . ''
If you do n't have your specific subject , you will find no job .
Because everything you can do , there are many people who can do it better than you .

Not only your age , your position in the company also determines whether you should have broad knowledge or specific subject .
If you are the manager , you should know something about economics , administration , and the products you provide .
But if you are a staff , you should care about what exactly the company want you to do .

"I agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of just specialize in one certain subject .
there are many reasons supporting my opinion .

First , I believe that academic subjects are the path leading to the knowledge of the world , therefore one should n't limit his or her time devoting within only one subject ; people , especially college students , should take various courses in all kinds of fields before they decide what certain academic field they wish to receive further education .
If we only study one certain field , we will loose the whole forest for one tree .

Second , I believe that although knowledge is categorized into assorted academic subjects , each individual subject is related to one another ; therefore we could not possibly understand one subject without studying the others .
For example , math is considered as `` the mother of all science , '' but people studying in philosophy still need to learn math in order to understand the foundation of logic , no less than researchers in physics , engineering , or finance fields .

Last but not least , as the old saying goes , `` Learning is like buliding a pyramid ; the broaden you build it , the taller it reaches . ''
By learning widely initially we can easily understand a specific subject later .
Moreover , if we cannot absorb a broad range of academic subjects , our perspectives will also be narrowed .
We wo n't be able to accept opposite ideas and multiple opinions from other , nor will we be willing to adopt new thoughts and images from subjects outside of our own instantly .

In conclusion , I believe that `` Jack of all trades is also Master of ONE . ''

With a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you can do better in your specialty .
I believe everybody knows Sherock Holmes , a famous dectective .
What made him the greatest dectective in the world ever ?
A broad knowledge .
Holmes is an expert in violin .
He has also achieved great success in chemistry .
What 's more , he has several books published on the how to raise bees .
It is the large amount of knowledge in all the subjects that made him a distinguished dectective .
I remembered in the case that several people died after they have gone to swim in a small lake , Holmes used his biology knowledge to solve it .
It turned out that there was a rather rare poisonous jellyfish in that lake .
If he had put all the efforts on his specific subject , maybe he would not be able to solve it .

When meeting with accidents , a specific knowledge may not offer much help .
Let us assume that poor David met with a leg fracture .
If he specializes in Chemistry and nothing else , he might sit there , crying .
However , if David has some knowledge besides Chemistry , he might know to place some ice on the injured leg .

Almost no one likes to hear a professional talk on the development on brass .

"In essence , I totally agree that a broad span of knowledge of many subjects is better than specialization in one subject .

A broad knowledge span of many academic fields contributes to the overall scholarly status , or level of education , of a person .
The world we live in revolves around everything we can perceive from science to literature to general knowledge .
For example , a physicist who can only talk about physics and the very technical areas of his field of study is , at least to me , very difficult to be called a scholarly person .
It is true that he may excel in his own field of specialization but he will find it to earn respect from people in the society in general , partly because his lack of knowledge of ` other ' subjects implicitly implies his disregard for the people engaged in these ` other ' subjects .
To me , this physicist can not be called an educated person .

In my opinion , no one field of specialization can evolve and flourish solely on its own .
After all , whatever ideas , however abstract , that are involved in that field are developed and perceived by human beings who live in the real world that comprises of all different things .
It is inevitable that even the most abstract of ideas in one field should have the slightest association to another idea most likely in another field .
Since these can be linked in some way or another , it is apparently condusive to know other fields in order to see these links and perhaps also to better the field of specialization .

Another advantage of a broad knowledge span is different approaches and perspectives to viewing a problem .
Different academic areas implement different ways of thinking about problems .
For example , maths mainly adopts logic and reasoning , while literature may use a more elegant and artistic style to viewing the world .
Realizing this should make a person more flexible in solving problems in general and better understand the things around us , or concepts in his field of specialization , in multiple perspectives .

The above re-emphasizes the fact that single specialization is not desirable .

"I disagree with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
I think having a broad field of knowledge is as important as specializing in one particular subject .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic field only allows one to know the shallower part of each subject .
One who does not specialize in any field can only be deemed as `` amateur '' , not `` professional '' .
A person with broad knowledge in many academic fields but no deep insights in any subject can never design gadgets as well as professional engineers do ; they can never navigate planes as well as professional aviators do ; they can never compose music pieces as remarkably as musicians do ...
Hence , we need people who specialize in one specific subject to make our world a better place and to run our society smoothly .

However , specializing in one one particular subject has drawbacks as well .
For example , in Singapore , the universities place too much emphasis on specialized knowledge .
That leads to a work force that is rather narrow-minded .
As a result , Singaporeans tend to be less creative and less likely to think out of the box .
Also , people with different academic field might have difficulty in communicating with each other , making people more isolated .
On the contrary , the tertiary education in the United States emphasizes on both specialized and broad knowledge of the students .
It makes people more prepared to make sound dicisions in complicated circumstances which involves different academic fields .
For instance , a politician who specializes in Politics only will not be able to make sound sound policies in environmental problems .
It is also likely that he might take the lobbists ' words blindly .
Hence , it is also important for one to have a broad range of knowedge .

On the one hand , some asserts that having a wide range of knowledge is better .
While others thinks that it is better to specialize in one subject .

Take engineers for example , They are very knowledgable when it comes to computer related problems .
But they are so isolated in their computer field that when it comes to other subjects they have no clue .
My friend John is the perfect example for such discussion .
He is an excellent student in the engineering field .
He can answer any question you might have regarding computers .
However , when we are talking about other subjects , such as , art history , he can not join our conversation at all .

Another problem with focusing on just one single subject is that you will not know what else is out there .
You might be interested in world history , but because you are specialized in one subject .
You have to spend all your time studying that subject and have no time to study world history .
One of these days , when you look back .
That might be the one thing that you regret the most .

Nevertheless , specialize in one subject have its advantages .
You will have a very clear and deep understanding of that subject .
But when we compare the advantage and disadvantage of specializing in one specific subject or not , the most obvious selection is to have a broad knowledge of various of academic subjects .

What 's more , there are too many things worth pondering over , if you are given the chance to pick some from an ocean of academic subjects , which ones are you going to selct ?
You may probably get lost in the immense subjects , or achieve nothing wandering among these subjects .

What I have argued above is based on my own experience , but we can neither go far when being tightly enclosed to a single subject .

if i had my way , i would fully side with the notion that the specialization in one specific subject will be the most important , because of the survival in competition .

what is beyond a shadow of doubt is that we live in a world where the knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time the more specialized it is , the highly it is regarded .
on the other hand , competition is a way of life in today 's world , most notably the capitalists which encourage the competition , however , competition as always contribute both benefits and detriments , and has been brought the notices of us , not only because its tremendous benefits , but also widespread plagues .
for instance , individuals and companies alike , for the sake of survivial in the competition , have to try their best to improve themselves , and the competitive edge comes frome the quality that shows more variation .
that is specalization .

so , what we could deduce from general principles is that the competition , which is continually mounting and shows no signs at the present of ceasing to rise , cause the necessity and importance of specialization in a certain area .

however , if there is a view that people should obtain miscellenanious knowledge of many academic sujects , because by this , they could knew our colorful world , which i take leave to suspect , then it is the romantic and naive people who create it , not those who never fail to be with considerations of reality , in so far as it is universal acknowledged that studying many subjects would wast our time , on the other hand , we should maximaze our time to study something that will help us live in the competition .

all things considered , if we deem the specialization as a trivial thing , and it will be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we will be without any considerations of competition , as i mentioned and explained above , will lead a worse situation that is losing our competitive edge and chance for survivial in the competition .

"While some of people prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , others aim at specializing in one specific subject .
What I address here is both of them are equally important to one person .
Not only broad knowledge we need , but aslo specifical knowledge in one specific field we must own .

By broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we can view the world in a total whole one .
Without broad knowledge of different subjects , we cannot comprehense the world correctly even .
There is a story available to sustain my assertment : long long ago , some blind men were talking about the real feature of a elephant .
Some of them had touched the legs of the elephant , so they said elephant was just like a great wall ; Some of them had touched the ears of the elephant , so they asserted that the elephant was just like a big plate ; Others of them had touched the tails of the elephant , so they conjured that the elephant was just like swings .
We may laugh at the conclusions made by the blind men , but we must admit that it is lacking of global views of the elephant that makes them so ridiculous .

So in my opinion , the most meaningful th of owning broad knowledge of many academic is to offer us a global view of the world , so we can march into the uncharted world without low propability to make such mistakes just like ones blind men made .

By specialized in one specific subject , we can explore the world deeper .
Without this insight , we can get nothing about the essense of the natural !
This is more important in recent years .
With the development of computers and Internet , the quantity of knowledge has explored in an incredible speed .
It is impossible for anyone to master all the knowledge of many academic subjects .
The society has shaped into a world of cooperations , for example , a car manufactory may design their engine in the US , make the tire in Indonesia , produce varieties of materials in China , and make all the matrials together into a complete car in Taiwan .
This trend has forces people to be an expert in a specific field .
From this point of view , it is very important for the contemporaries to specialize in one specific subject .

In conclusion , we must own a broad knowledge of many academic subjects to avoid some obvious stupid mistakes which are not consistent with the basic principles of many academic subjects .
At the same time , we also pursue to be a expert in one specific subject to cooperate with others and contribute to the development of society .

"Nowadays people who have broad knowlege of many academic subjects will more accepted from the society than those who only specialize in one specific subject .

First , people who master more subject tend to gain more money .
For example , a person master two language , English and German .
There are maybe most of the employees in a company only master English .
In case the company need to negotiate with a German company and needs a person who can comunicate with the German smoothly .
In this situation , the person who master German will take this job .
If he can take good use of such chance , for instance , to perform himself in good manner and susccessful finish the negotiation work , he will make good impression to his boss .
And because of the appreciation from his boss , his chance of promotion is obviously bigger than that of his coworkers .
Therefore , he is more likely to earn money than others do .

Moreover , people with broad knowledge may have a wilder selection of doing work .
For example , my major subject is marketing , if I have time , I definetely will choose another subject as second subject .
Nowadays , the competition of pursuming a job is more stressful than ever before .
If I only master the subject of marketing , I may fail to find a job easily .
But things are changed if I master another subject such like computer technik .
I can choose a job among the IT companies .
And I will surely have a bigger chance to get a job .

From what have been discussed above , it is undoubted coming to the conclusion that it is better for someone to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

"I agree that it would be betther to have diversified knowledge in many fields , rather than focusing on a particular subject .
In many universities around the world , the idea of providing all-rounded education for students has been promoting in recent years , which would be the proof of a need of having broad knowledge .

There are several reasons supporting my view .
First , the boundaries of subjects sometimes are difficult to be distinguished since most subjects have connections with the others .
For instance , the learing of accounting would also require some computer skills since accounting nowadays is not confined to manual work .
Therefore , if we have already accumulated fundamental knowledge on the use of specific softwares like MYOB , it would definitely help learn the core subject more effectively .

Second , we would always encounter people from different streams of study and different knowledge , and therefore if we have knowledge in the other fields , it would be easier for us to start a conversation and learn from the others .
We would know the philosophy of different kinds of people since people often developed their logic based on their knowledge and experience learnt from their field of study .
Hence , we may find it easy to cooperate with the others when working in the society .

Last but not least , it would help us develop critical thinking skills with accumulating knowledge in other fields .
If we only concentrate on studying our own major subjects , our thinking and ideas would be confined to a particular route .
Take the subjects of economics and accounting as an example , in economics , students would be taught that assets would be determined on cash basis .
However , throughout the learning of accounting , students would be exposed to accrual concept , which is to recognize our future revenues as our income at the moment .
From the above example , we can see that students with both economics and accounting knowlege may be exposed to disimilar ideas on the related topic , so that they would learn more about the incompleteness of specific subjects .

All in all , we would become all-rounded if we can receive fundamental knowledge in numerous field .
The more diverse the knowledge we have , the less difficulty we would have during our learning and working .
",P1,CHI,high,0
"When it comes to whether one should have broad knowledge or just specialize in one specific subject , different people have different opinions .
While broad knowledge usually equipts a person to become a generalist , focused and deep knowledge can turn a person into a specialist .
Both ways have advantages and disadvantages , but as far as I am concerned , I think it 's better to specialize in a certain area .

As we have entered the information era , large flows of information has come into our life , and many new subjects have appeared .
Unlike ancient people , who could only deal with simple subjects like astronomy , math and philosophy , modern people have too much knowledge to deal with .
It 's quite unrealistic for people nowadays to learn everything that is accessible .
Every subject has its own knowledge system , and every system has its specific development and application .
Time wo n't allow us to dig into every subject .
If anyone wants to study every subject , he will end with learning nothing .

Moreover , it would be more beneficial for us to specialize in certain areas .
For one thing , we can devote our full energy and effort into that area which could ensure a better gain out of it .
For another thing , to be an expert in one area can be truly useful for the society .
For example , many scientists are focusing their attention to the research in their specific area , and due to their focus and devotion , we can enjoy so many achievements in the science .
Another example is many professions give high respect and credit to those experts , such as doctors and teachers .
Because of their experience and devotions , the society can benefit from their accumulating contributions .

However , to specialize in one area does n't mean knowing nothing about knowledge in other areas .
While schools require students to choose a specific major , they also should provide chances for students to get in touch with other areas .
For example , an engineering student can focus on his or her major study , at the same time , he or she can also have arts or history as optional courses .
It 's vital for students to have a broad view about the world .

In conclusion , all the points I have discussed above have proved that to specialize in one area is better for students .

"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older individuals need not be a universal truth. Enjoyment is highly individualized and can vary significantly from person to person, regardless of their age group.

Older individuals may have a refined sense of what brings them happiness due to decades of self-discovery. They often find joy in deeper aspects of life, such as meaningful relationships, accomplishments, and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. Additionally, many seniors express greater life satisfaction through involvement in communities and intergenerational activities, which provide a sense of purpose and belonging.

Conversely, young people, though often vibrant and adventurous, can be burdened by the uncertainties and pressures of establishing a stable foundation for their lives, including career development and forming long-term relationships. These stressors can impact their ability to enjoy life.

In conclusion, both young and older people are capable of experiencing profound enjoyment at different stages of their lives, and both may encounter unique challenges that affect their happiness. It is not so much the age but how individuals approach life and overcome obstacles that determines their capacity for enjoyment.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The portrait of youth as a golden era of unbridled joy, brimming with unspoiled horizons and the allure of unfettered potential, is a narrative as old as time. Keen to make their mark on the world, young individuals embark on journeys of self-discovery and adventure with a vigor that is emblematic of their age. They move to find themselves within friendships that feel eternal, educational endeavors that promise growth, and fleeting moments that appear infinite.

Such verve enables young people to extract enjoyment from life with both hands, turning their gaze toward the myriad of opportunities that lie ahead. Their definition of happiness is closely tied to the pursuit of the extraordinary, the challenge of boundaries pushed, and the taste of victoriesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂpersonal or collectiveÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthat lay the foundations of the stories they will one day tell.

Nevertheless, the joy of the youth is not the only shade of happiness that colors the human experience. As individuals transition into the later chapters of life, the lens through which they view enjoyment undergoes a subtle, yet powerful, refraction. The older generations take pleasure in the legacy of what they have built and the quiet majesty of ordinary days well-lived. For them, joy is steeped in reflection, connection, and the gentle passing of time. It lies within the familiar faces of family, the continued pursuit of lifelong passions, and the rich internal life crafted by years of accumulated wisdom. In recognizing the contrasting yet equally rewarding enjoyments of both youth and old age, we come to appreciate the multifaceted nature of joy itself, indefinable by age alone.",P2,CHI,high,1
"I disagree with the blanket assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people. Enjoyment is a multi-dimensional aspect of life, deriving from health, financial stability, social connections, and personal fulfillment, which are factors not solely dependent on age.

Older adults, through their wealth of life experiences, often gain clarity on what truly matters to them, leading to enjoyment grounded in realistic expectations and sincere gratitude for life's offerings. For instance, older individuals may relish the pleasure of hobbies they have crafted over a lifetime or the joy of spending unhurried time with family and friends.

Moreover, age often brings with it a form of liberation from the intense societal pressures faced by youth, such as the quest for success, beauty, and social acceptance. This release from social expectations can open the door for older adults to enjoy life on their own terms, free from conformity.

Additionally, while it is true that youth is associated with exploration and discovery, the uncertainties and responsibilities of establishing oneself can contribute to stress, potentially detracting from overall life enjoyment during those years.

In conclusion, enjoyment of life is not the exclusive province of the young. While the form of enjoyment may evolve, older adults often find contentment in life's deeper aspects, surpassing the fleeting excitements that characterize youth.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The impression that young people enjoy life to a greater extent than the elderly presupposes that joy is primarily derived from external experiences and that these experiences are more accessible in youth. Indeed, young individuals are often seen as being at the epicenter of life's party, engaging fully with the world around them. Sports, social events, and adventures are within arm's reach, their bodies resilient, and their minds sculpted by curiosity and ambition.

However, joy is as much an internal state as it is influenced by external factors. Older adults, potentially less engaged in the relentless chase for novel stimuli, might find equal happiness in moments of calm and introspection. There is a depth to their contentment, found in the mastery of a lifelong hobby, the continued pursuit of knowledge, or the companionship that thrives on decades of shared experiences.

Moreover, the significance of legacy provides a unique source of fulfillment for the elderly. Contributing to their communities, leaving lasting impressions on those around them, and feeling connected to a larger narrative offer an internally generated happiness that should not be discounted.",P2,CHI,high,1
"I disagree with the assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people. Enjoyment is subjective and can be experienced at different intensities throughout various stages of life. Numerous factors beyond age contribute to one's ability to enjoy life, including health, social connections, financial stability, and personal outlook.

Firstly, older individuals often have the benefit of experience, which can lead to a greater sense of gratitude and joy for the accomplishments and simple pleasures life presents. They typically have more time to enjoy leisure activities and can often afford to indulge in hobbies or travel, which they may not have had time for earlier in life due to career or family obligations.

Moreover, older adults are generally better at managing negative emotions and stress, according to studies on emotional regulation. They can navigate life's ups and downs with a seasoned perspective that can enhance their overall enjoyment.

Conversely, while young people may have fewer health concerns and a larger social circle, the pressures of establishing a career, forming lasting relationships, and discovering their place in the world can lead to considerable stress and anxiety, potentially overshadowing the enjoyment of their youthful years.

In conclusion, the suggestion that young people have an exclusive claim to enjoying life more than older individuals is a misconception that overlooks the complexities of happiness across the lifespan.",P2,CHI,high,1
"Contemplating the complex tapestry of human enjoyment, the argument is often posited that the young dwell at the heart of lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs jubilations. With the flame of passion burning bright and responsibilityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs shadow merely a whisper at the edge of consciousness, young people leap into the fray of life with abandon. The exhilaration of first loves, the adrenaline of competitive pursuits, and the pure zest of unfettered exploration encapsulate a world where every dawn heralds new joy, every dusk promises the hope of dreams unspent.

Yet it would be an injustice to the rich mosaic of life to surmise that the siren call of enjoyment fades as one traverses the continuum into one's twilight years. Our elders, seasoned by the passage of time, might trade the exultant cry of youthful ecstasy for the low hum of contented fulfillment, but this is not to imply their days are devoid of pleasure. Through the magnifying glass of time, what were once brash desires mature into a grateful embracing of lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs simplicitiesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa grandchildÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs innocent query, the familiar cadence of a lifetime partnerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs laughter, or the steady ritual of a shared meal with family. The accumulation of lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs seasons does not strip away the capacity for joy; rather, it distills it to its essence, concentrating delight in the depth of experiences rather than the breadth.

In elderhood, enjoyment often emerges from the subtler aspects of existence. There is profound joy embedded in the legacy one leaves behind, in the mentoring of younger souls, in the wisdom imparted and the stories shared. The once raucous symphony of life's adventures shifts into a mellifluous harmony that resonates with the quiet confidence of understanding oneÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs place in the cycle of life.

Moreover, the elderly have the unique privilege of savoring the facets of life they may have overlooked in the vigor of youth, teaching us that enjoyment need not always be synonymous with activity and dynamism. There is a different kind of enjoyment to be found in reflection, in the slow savoring of a moment, in the appreciation of life's inherent impermanence.

In conclusion, the arc of human enjoyment is not simply an arc at all, but rather a richly textured spiral where every age offers its own flavor of joy. Youth and age need not compete on the spectrum of delight, for they are complementary forces in the grand narrative of human existence. Whether through exuberant discovery or tranquil appreciation, life weaves a tapestry of enjoyment for all who seek to find it, regardless of the number of years they have lived.",P2,CHI,high,1
"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do to a certain extent, but with caution against overgeneralization. Youth is often equated with vitality and the pursuit of pleasures, and indeed, many young individuals actively seek out and revel in diverse experiences that life has to offer.

The energy and open-mindedness of youth can translate into a bold and adventurous spirit. Young people tend to engage more in physical activities and social gatherings, and they often have a curiosity and appetite for travel and new experiences that can heighten their enjoyment of life.

Furthermore, young people typically have fewer health concerns, which gives them a greater ability to participate in a variety of enjoyable experiences without the limitations that might come with older age.

However, it is important to recognize that older individuals, despite potential physical limitations, may experience profound enjoyment in aspects of life such as family, community, and intellectual pursuits. The satisfaction derived from a life well-lived and the wisdom gained from years of experience can contribute substantially to older adults' enjoyment of life.

In conclusion, while the physical and social aspects of youth might lend themselves to more overt expressions of enjoyment, it should not be underestimated that older people also enjoy life, albeit in potentially more introspective and meaningful ways.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The comparison between young and older peopleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs enjoyment of life is not straightforward, as both age groups can experience profound joy and fulfillment. However, I lean towards disagreeing with the assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people.

Older individuals often have the advantage of perspective, allowing them to focus on what truly brings them happiness. With age comes the ability to prioritize life's pleasures and eliminate the unnecessary distractions that often occupy the lives of the younger generation.

Furthermore, many older people have established a sense of security in their identities, relationships, and finances. This stability can contribute to a more relaxed and enjoyable life, free from the existential quests that often mark younger years.

That said, it is undeniable that youth is a time of exploration and discovery, filled with new experiences that can bring great enjoyment. However, the challenges of finding one's way in the world can also make this period stressful and less enjoyable for some.

In essence, enjoyment of life is not the exclusive province of any age group. Both young and older people have unique advantages that can contribute to a fulfilling life experience.",P2,CHI,high,1
"One could argue that young people have an innate predilection for savoring life in ways that older individuals cannot. The vitality that characterizes youth emboldens them to plunge into activities with gustoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwhether that be sports, learning, activism, or the myriad forms of entertainment vying for their attention. Theirs is a life often lived loudly and publicly, amplified by social media and a culture that venerates novelty and youthfulness.

Adventures are embarked upon with the gleeful assurance that there will be many more to come, and every relationship, triumph, or failure is heightened by the keen intensity of fresh experiences. For the young, life's banquet is spread out before them in a seemingly endless array, with each joy a discovery and each setback a lesson stored for future reflection.

But to say that the older generations stand apart from such enjoyment is to misconstrue the nature of joy itself. With advancing years, the locus of happiness often shifts from external to internal and from the future to the present. The mirth of the elderly may not be as visible or as voluble as that of the young, but it resides in the satisfaction of seeing younger generations thrive, in the leisure to pursue long-neglected hobbies, and in the subtle daily rhythms that offer a quiet and consistent sort of pleasure often overlooked by the young.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a generalization that fails to account for the individual variations in life satisfaction across the age spectrum. I believe that enjoyment of life is less about age and more about oneÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs circumstances and mindset.

One reason why young people might be perceived as enjoying life more is their physical health and energy levels, which enable them to engage in a variety of activities. They are often more willing to try new things and embrace change, which can lead to exciting experiences.

However, this does not inherently mean that older people enjoy life less. Older individuals often have the benefit of hindsight and life experience, which can lead to a more contented and fulfilling life. They may find joy in things like family, friendships that have stood the test of time, and hobbies they have cultivated over the years.

Furthermore, enjoyment of life often comes from a sense of accomplishment and purpose, which can be achieved at any age. Older adults may derive considerable satisfaction from past achievements and contributing to the lives of younger generations through mentorship and guidance.

In conclusion, while young people may have certain advantages that can lead to enjoyment of life, older individuals also have unique factors that contribute to their life satisfaction. It is therefore reductive to state that one group enjoys life more than the other.",P2,CHI,high,1
"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Enjoyment of life is not exclusively determined by age but by an individualÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs perspective, experiences, and attitudes toward life.

Firstly, older individuals often have a more profound appreciation for life. With years of experience comes the wisdom to savor moments and the maturity to manage hardships with grace. For example, older adults tend to report higher levels of emotional well-being and are better at finding joy in everyday experiences compared to their younger counterparts.

Secondly, older people generally have more freedom to pursue their interests. With retirement and children becoming independent, they have the opportunity to explore hobbies, travel, or volunteer, enriching their enjoyment of life.

Lastly, it is a misconception that youth is devoid of challenges. Young people face pressures of career building, establishing relationships, and finding their place in the world, which can be stressful and impinge on their enjoyment of life.

In conclusion, the capacity to enjoy life is not inherently tied to youth. Older individuals, through accumulated wisdom and the freedom to pursue their passions, often find deep enjoyment in their later years.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The ideology that young people monopolize the enjoyment of life is pervasive, yet it is a notion that dismisses the multidimensional nature of joy. In their prime, young individuals stand at the crossroads of opportunity, where every path is alight with the potential for growth, love, and adventure. They experience life with an intensity that is often fueled by the newness of their encountersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂfrom the electrifying rush of friendship and romance to the daunting, yet exhilarating, choices that mold their future.

The impulse to embrace one's individuality, to stand on the precipice of the unfamiliar, to triumph against challengesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂall are the privileges attached to the vivacious years of youth. These years are a visceral exploration of lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs intricate dance, a time of palpable, magnificent reckoning with the vast panorama of human experience.

Contrast this with the serene, acquired joy of the elder generation. In the golden years, denied the relentless energy of youth, older adults cultivate a different genre of enjoyment. Enveloped in the comfort of routine, the joy of mature individuals may lie in the traditions they uphold, the steady rhythm of a day whose pattern is familiar and reassuring.

Engaging richly with the past, they delight in sharing the sagas of their years, deriving enjoyment from the interplay of memory and the present day. Theirs is a joy that transcends the physicality of youth, embracing instead the mental and emotional landscapes where contentment has been carefully sown and nurtured. To fully appreciate the essence of enjoyment, one must recognize that it transcends age, taking myriad forms throughout the journey of life.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The axiom, often floated in social discourse, that young people possess an intrinsic talent for enjoying life more than their older counterparts, speaks to observable truths yet skirts the more clandestine realities of contentment. Youth indisputably dances in a season of expanding horizons, wherein each new dawn may unfurl with the unpredictable winds of discovery and anticipation.

The competing demands of strenuous academia, burgeoning careers, and the forging of meaningful relationships that dominate the youthful epoch do not dampen their spirit; instead, they are often sources of immense pride and enjoyment, adding layers of richness to the narrative of one's life.

Yet, as the cycle of life spirals outward, the sands of time alter the landscape of joy. Older individuals, having crossed the meridian of life's chronology, may appear to outsiders as vessels retiring to the harbor, but within these hulls thrives an appreciation for life's simpler joys: a grandchild's laughter, the comfort of familiar stories retold, the pleasures of past struggles now transcended.

It is within this complex interplay of vitality and reflection where one discerns the subtle proposition that, regardless of age, the potential for enjoyment courses abundantly through the veins of life.
",P2,CHI,high,1
"The exultation of youth reverberates through cultures and epochs, celebrated as a time when life is its most rapturous. Young people stand on the cusp of their own becoming, where days and nights are canvases for dreams and experiments in living. The ardor of building careers, igniting romances, or shaping identities lends every action the weight and sheen of significance. They are perceived to be living at a pitch that older generations can only recall with a nostalgic pang.

The freedom young people possess manifests in unrestrained social interactions, cross-cultural explorations, and technological connectivity that spans the globe. Their proneness to revelry and resistance to the status quo are characteristic of an age where fortitude is abundant, and every choice feels pregnant with opportunity. This tapestry of the new, bolstered by the tenacity of youth, seems to promise an exclusive claim on enjoyment.

Yet, itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs a perspective that undervalues the labyrinth of fulfillment available to those who have journeyed through youth's labyrinth and emerged into the calmer seas of later years. Older individuals often experience a distilled form of joyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂless combustible, perhaps, but no less profound. There is joy in hindsight, in the observation of cycles of life coming full circle, and in the ongoing communion with nature, art, and literature. It's a contentment that springs from a deep well of cultivated interests, enduring friendships, and an unshakable sense of self that anchors them through what might outwardly seem a more subdued phase of life.",P2,CHI,high,1
"It's a common perception that youth equates with an inherent ability to enjoy life more robustly than in older age. This notion stems from the idea that young people possess an abundance of energy, fewer responsibilities, and an open road of possibilities before them. They are in the spring of life, where every experienceÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbe it love, travel, or careerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂis fresh, vibrant, and imbued with the excitement of the first encounter.

Indeed, the young often seize life with a ferocity born of their natural zest, daring to dream and act in ways that may seem unattainable to later generations. They have the strength to test their limits, the time to recover from disappointments, and the societal permission to experiment across the spectrum of social, professional and personal spheres.

However, to suggest that this is the pinnacle of life's enjoyment misses half the conversation. As the tides of time advance, the purview of joy can expand for older individuals. With age comes a nexus of different pleasures: the pride in seeing one's children flourish, the space to revisit passions forsaken to necessities like raising a family or building a career, and the wisdom to appreciate life's nuances. Their joy might shine less conspicuously, but it can glow as warmly, shaped by a broader understanding of life's fragile temporality.",P2,CHI,high,1
"To declare unequivocally that either the dawning spring of youth or the tranquil autumn of older age holds the monopoly on life's merriment is to simplify a profoundly individual experience. Life's joy is a mosaic, composed of a multitude of shades, textures, and patterns, with each person weaving their unique blend of happiness.

Young hearts, propelled by boundless curiosity and unfettered by life's weightier encumbrances, may indeed seem to race more eagerly towards pleasure's embrace. Theirs is a world where each dawn can herald untrodden paths and untouched heights, a state of perpetual potential it seems, where joy is as much about the anticipation as the actualization.

Yet, it would be an oversight to conclude that as the sun arcs towards the horizon of one's existence, the spectrum of enjoyment dims. With a more selective gaze, the mature mind may derive profound elation from legacy and lore, from finding purpose in mentoring young saplings or savoring the fruits of a life's labor cultivated through seasons of joy and adversity.

In essence, adjudicating which age group possesses a greater affinity for life's pleasures is an exercise in subjectivity. The capacity for enjoyment evolves, shaped by time's passage, but it need not diminish with the cresting of years.",P2,CHI,high,1
"I am inclined to agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people, primarily due to the zest and resilience often associated with youth. The youth phase is filled with first-time experiences, milestones, and opportunities for personal growth ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ all of which can contribute to a heightened sense of enjoyment.

Young individuals typically have more energy and fewer chronic health concerns than older adults, making it easier for them to participate in a variety of activities that bring pleasure, such as sports, travel, and social events. The thrill of exploring new places, learning new skills, and meeting new people can significantly enhance one's enjoyment of life.

Additionally, young people tend to be more optimistic, which can positively affect their enjoyment. They often look forward to their future with anticipation and hope, viewing life as full of possibilities and opportunities.

However, this perception should not diminish the experiences of older individuals, many of whom also report high levels of satisfaction and contentment. Memories, wisdom, and the freedom that comes with retirement can lead to a different, but no less significant, kind of enjoyment.

In essence, while the biological and social freedoms associated with youth can lead to increased enjoyment, it is also important to acknowledge that enjoyment of life continues in various forms as one grows older.",P2,CHI,high,1
"I disagree with the assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people. Enjoyment of life is a complex and personal experience that varies widely among individuals and can change over time. While youth may offer certain advantages, such as physical health and fewer life responsibilities, these do not guarantee a greater capacity for enjoyment.

Older people often enjoy life in different, perhaps deeper ways than their younger counterparts. With age comes a level of wisdom and life experience that can enhance one's appreciation for life. Older persons also tend to prioritize their emotional well-being, pursuing activities and relationships that bring them joy and contentment.

Moreover, senior citizens can embrace the freedom that comes with retirement and finished child-rearing responsibilities, allowing them to explore new hobbies, travel, or volunteerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂopportunities that can significantly contribute to their enjoyment of life.

In contrast, while young people may have more opportunities for physical activities and socializing, they also face pressures of establishing themselves in their careers and personal lives, which can be sources of stress and anxiety.

In summary, the capacity to enjoy life is less about age and more about one's outlook and circumstances. Older individuals, through their accumulated experiences and freedom, often have just as much potential to enjoy life as younger individuals.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The statement suggesting that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplification that doesn't necessarily reflect reality. Enjoyment is not exclusively the domain of the young; it can be experienced by individuals of all ages, depending on various factors such as health, lifestyle, and personal outlook.

One could argue that the young enjoy life through exploratory and often impulsive adventures, possessing the health and freedom to immerse themselves in a wide array of experiences. Their enjoyment often stems from newnessÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa world full of opportunities and without the constraints of serious health issues or the many obligations facing older individuals.

However, older people have their own aspects of life that they can enjoy. They can savor the luxury of time post-retirement to engage in hobbies or passions that they may have deferred due to career or family responsibilities. Also, the enjoyment derived from the deep connections forged with family and friends over many years can be fulfilling.

Moreover, the resilience that older individuals often display, the ability to find joy in the face of life's challenges, can signify a more profound enjoyment than the typically fleeting pleasures of youth.

In conclusion, enjoyment of life may manifest differently in the young and the old, but it is not the age itself that dictates the capacity for enjoyment. Both young and older individuals can find immense joy in their lives, influenced by their unique experiences, values, and perceptions.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The vibrant energy of youth often paints a picture of boundless joy and uninhibited exploration, leading to the widely held belief that young individuals inherently savor the flavors of life more intensely than their elder counterparts. Nevertheless, such a viewpoint tends to overlook the nuanced tapestry of fulfillment that can grace the later stages of life.

While youth undeniably offers robust health and the alluring prospects of future achievements, these factors alone do not constitute the entirety of enjoyment. Youngsters, brimming with the zest to discover, might traverse continents, connect through pulsing social networks, and chase adrenaline-rush adventures, all hallmarks of a seemingly exuberant existence.

Conversely, the golden years bestow upon mature individuals an orchestra of quieter yet resonant pleasures. Beyond the veil of aging lies the treasure trove of cultivated patience and reflection which can transform mundane moments into instances of profound serenity. The pride of past accomplishments or witnessing one's progeny blossom are joys exclusive to the chronology of maturity.

Thus, to assert the superiority of youth's enjoyment without acknowledging the depth of elder satisfaction would be a failure to appreciate the full scope of life's symphony.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The vibrant narrative of youth, with its emphasis on spontaneity and discovery, champions the idea that life is most vividly enjoyed by those unfettered by age's inexorable march. Young individuals, with their resilience and unmarked canvases, seemingly navigate life with a lust for experiences that are luminous with possibility and saturated with the anticipation of future triumphs.

Yet, the enjoyment of life does not wane as the autumnal years approach; rather, it transforms, adopting new hues and expressions. As with a masterly crafted symphony that evolves from the vigorous chords of its opening movements to the more measured but richly textured adagios of its conclusion, the elderly experience a different, often more meditative, enjoyment. Nadirs and zeniths of a life replete with stories sculpt an appreciation of existence rooted in realism and resilience.

Enjoyment, then, is not the exclusive domain of the sprightly and young, but a gift that continues to evolve and adapt, offering each age its verse in the enduring song of life.

"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do, but with the acknowledgment that enjoyment is subjective and can vary widely among individuals.

Young people are often seen as embodying a zest for life that stems from their physical vitality and openness to new experiences. The energy and health of youth allow for a level of activity and exploration that can decline with age, offering young individuals more opportunities to enjoy life's adventures.

Additionally, young people are typically less encumbered by the responsibilities and commitments that increase with age. Without the weight of extensive duties, young people can move freely and take risks that may lead to enjoyable and fulfilling experiences.

Furthermore, young individuals often have a more optimistic outlook, which can color their perception of life as more enjoyable. This optimism is a result of having their whole lives ahead of them, filled with potential and opportunities.

In conclusion, while the ability to enjoy life can occur at any age, young people are more likely to experience it due to their physical health, fewer responsibilities, and optimistic outlook on life.",P2,CHI,high,1
"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people, primarily because youth is often associated with freedom, exploration, and the peak of one's physical and mental capacities.

Young people typically have fewer health-related limitations, enabling them to partake in a wide array of activities that can contribute to their enjoyment of life. Whether it's engaging in sports, embarking on adventurous travels, or enjoying nightlife, younger individuals often have the energy and desire to experience these moments to the fullest.

Moreover, young people usually face less responsibility and societal pressure, granting them the latitude to experiment with different lifestyles, careers, and relationships. This freedom to explore can lead to an exhilarating sense of self-discovery and fulfillment.

Furthermore, younger individuals can often bounce back from setbacks more quickly due to the resiliency associated with youth. The ability to recover and maintain a positive outlook after facing challenges can contribute significantly to one's enjoyment of life.

In conclusion, while older people undoubtedly experience enjoyment, the peak physical condition, flexibility, and resilience of youth provide younger individuals with distinct advantages in experiencing life's pleasures.",P2,CHI,high,1
"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. Enjoyment of life is not age-dependent, but rather influenced by an individual's mindset, life experiences, and the ability to find contentment regardless of circumstances.

Firstly, older individuals often have a more mature perspective on life, having learned to appreciate the value of experiences, relationships, and personal growth. They may derive joy from things like spending time with family, indulging in long-standing hobbies, and passing on their wisdom to younger generations.

Secondly, many older people experience a newfound sense of freedom after retirement, allowing them to rediscover passions or explore new interests without the constraints of a job or raising a family. This can result in a resurgence of enjoyment and fulfillment that they may not have experienced in their youth.

Lastly, while young people may possess a certain vivacity and enthusiasm for life, they also face existential challenges, such as forging a career path and building their identities, which can be stressful and potentially diminish overall enjoyment of life.

In summary, the ability to enjoy life is not intrinsically tied to youth; older adults often find joy in ways that are different yet equally valuable as those experienced by younger individuals.",P2,CHI,high,1
"Contemporary society frequently casts the narrative that the fountain of youth bubbles with the essence of sheer delightÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa misconception that warrants scrutiny. The premise that young people inherently indulge in life's offerings more wholly than their senior counterparts invites debate when considering the relative nature of contentment.

Adolescents and young adults embark on formative journeys, laden with the thrill of self-discovery and the pursuit of passions. The liberty to aim for lofty goals and reshape one's destiny is indeed a privilege of the young, furnishing their days with the gloss of new encounters and dreams yet untouched by the erosion of time.

Yet, it would be remiss to dismiss the cultivated contentment that many seniors cherish. Seasoned by life's myriad bitters, the elder palette often finds a sweeter savor in the subtleties of existenceÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe familiarity of a well-loved melody, the intricate dance of a garden tended by seasoned hands, or the depth of a lifelong companionship.

Each life phase offers a unique brand of satisfaction, mellowed or vibrant, asserting that contentment is not a finite resource depleted with age but rather an evolving state, ever-present if only one adjusts their lens to perceive it.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The dichotomy between the jovial recklessness of youth and the serene contentment that often characterizes older age presents a fascinating landscape for exploration. There is a prevailing sentiment that youth is a period steeped in the purest forms of enjoyment, an era where opportunities for happiness unfurl like the boundless sea before the eager sailor.

Youthful individuals seem to spearhead life with an almost infectious exuberance. They approach each day as if it were a canvas for their passions, painting broad strokes with the colors of spontaneity, friendship, romance, and ambition. It is a time when the self is both malleable and bold, driven by dreams yet undulled by the oft harsh patina of realityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa prime state where physical resilience affords them the audacity to envisage and enact plans and pleasures that will echo into the tales of tomorrow.

As the journey progresses and time etches its history upon the individual, the nature of enjoyment tends to transmute. The tempests of youth give way to the calm seas of later years where older adults may bask in the glow of accomplishments earned and relationships fostered. They find a rhythm in the familiar, a dance to the quiet tune of reflection and appreciation. Their sense of enjoyment is seldom flaunted with fanfare but resonates deeply in the subtleties of daily lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂquiet conversations, the cultivation of a garden, or the indulgence in hobbies that have warmed the soul over many years.

Life's later chapters often unveil the luxury of hindsight, enabling older generations to synthesize joy not from the frenetic chase of experiences but from the gentle embrace of each moment's inherent value. With wisdom as their guide, they navigate the waters of existence with a steady hand, rejoicing in the legacy they are sculpting with each passing day.",P2,CHI,high,1
"It is a widely espoused belief that lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs sweetest nectar is most readily grasped by the young. After all, the dance of youth is one characterized by vigor and dreams unabated, where each experience bursts with potential and the promise of fulfillment. The young heart, unscarred by the trials of time, beats with a rhythm that pulses towards the incessant exploration of love, laughter, and the pursuit of meaning.

The laughter of young people often rings loudest at the summits of mountains climbed and in the depths of valleys exploredÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂliteral and metaphorical. Their quest for enjoyment can resemble a voyage with boundless horizons, sailed with the brisk winds of curiosity and a thirst for the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnever-before-seenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ. Educational pursuits, social escapades, and an ever-expanding arena of digital engagement fill their days with diverse shades of joy and self-expression.

In the autumn of life, however, a seasoned grace comes into play. Elderly individuals wear their years like a tapestry of intricate patterns, each thread a memory, each color a testament to a moment of past joy, sorrow, or triumph. Their enjoyment is of a different caliber, measured not in the frequency of adrenaline spikes but in the depth of connection to the world around them. The richness of experience affords the aged a palette from which to draw solace and pleasureÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂfrom long-held traditions, the gentle cadence of nature, or the simple act of sharing stories that bridge generations.

The intergenerational dialogue on the essence of enjoyment reveals that though the expressions of our delight may shift as we voyage through seasons, the capacity to relish life remains an eternal and undiscriminating gift.
",P2,CHI,high,1
"I concur with the statement that young people generally enjoy life more than older people, especially when considering the stage of life and its associated freedoms and possibilities.

Youth is often characterized by a sense of invincibility and an eagerness to experience lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs diverse opportunities. Younger individuals typically have fewer health concerns, which enables them to partake in a wider range of physical and social activities that contribute to their enjoyment of life.

Moreover, the younger demographic is less burdened by the weighty responsibilities that may accompany older age, such as career pressures or familial obligations. This relative freedom can lead to a more carefree and enjoyable lifestyle.

In contrast, older people might experience limitations due to health issues, decreased mobility, or other age-related factors, which can diminish their ability to relish life to the fullest.

However, it is essential to recognize that individual experiences can vary greatly and that many older individuals lead fulfilling and joyful lives. Thus, while the potential for enjoyment may be higher in youth, there are countless older adults who defy this trend and embrace life with vigor.",P2,CHI,high,1
"I disagree with the notion that young people inherently enjoy life more than older people. The capacity for enjoyment is a personal attribute that transcends age and is influenced by various factors like attitude, health, and life circumstances.

Older people can possess a richer appreciation for life's nuances due to their expansive life experiences. They may take pleasure in the simple things that younger individuals often overlook, such as a quiet morning or the company of a long-time friend.

Additionally, older adults usually have more control over their time and may have fewer work-related stresses. This freedom allows them to pursue hobbies and interests at their leisure, contributing to their enjoyment.

It is also important to note that young people, despite their youth and potential for vitality, face unique pressures related to education, career, and social identity that can detract from their overall enjoyment of life.

In summary, while youth may offer certain advantages, life enjoyment is not the exclusive domain of the young. Older people often have the wisdom, freedom, and perspective to find deep satisfaction and joy in their later years.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The notion that young people inherently enjoy life more than older people is a broad generalization that I believe is incorrect. Enjoyment of life is not solely tied to one's age but is influenced by personal attitudes, life circumstances, health, and social connections.

Older individuals often have a deep appreciation for life, developed through many years of diverse experiences. They may find enjoyment in established relationships, personal achievements, and the pursuit of interests that they may not have had the opportunity to explore when they were younger due to career or family commitments.

In addition, many older people have a clearer understanding of what happiness means to them and are often less affected by peer pressure or societal expectations, allowing them to live life more authentically and joyfully.

Meanwhile, it is true that young people may experience the excitement of new adventures and the freedom associated with fewer responsibilities. Nevertheless, they can also face significant stressors, such as academic pressures, career uncertainty, and the challenge of forming their identity.

In conclusion, while young people may seem to have a monopoly on enjoyment due to their age, older individuals often possess the wisdom, experience, and freedom that can lead to a profound enjoyment of life's latter stages.",P2,CHI,high,1
"agree that young people tend to enjoy life more than older people, but with the caution that enjoyment of life can be highly subjective and influenced by numerous variables that are independent of age. Youth tend to be associated with energy, enthusiasm for life, and the pursuit of novel experiences, which can collectively contribute to a sense of enjoyment.

Young people benefit from robust physical health, allowing them to engage in a broader spectrum of activities, from sports to travel, that can enhance their overall enjoyment of life. They are often more willing and able to embrace spontaneous adventures, which can amplify the perception that they experience greater enjoyment.

In addition, the young typically have yet to assume the full scope of adult responsibilities, such as managing a career, maintaining a home, or caring for a family. This relatively carefree period of life can afford them the freedom to prioritize personal pleasure over other demands, adding to their capacity for enjoyment.

However, it is imperative to acknowledge that the joys of older adults are no less significant, though they may manifest in different ways. Satisfaction from lifelong achievements, the simplicity of a leisurely pace of life, and the companionship of long-established relationships contribute to enjoyment in later years.

In essence, while there may be a perception that youth inherently enjoy life more, older people also experience joy and contentment, stemming from the fulfillment and knowledge accumulated over time.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The vivacity of youth is often romanticized as the era brimming with the purest form of joy. It is the springtime of life, where energy is abundant, and the journey ahead is lush with the promise of newness and excitement. The courageous pursuit of aspirations, the unbridled passion in the eyes of young lovers, and the intoxicating freedom to create oneself afresh are the revered emblems of youthÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs happiness.

Young individuals naturally embody a sense of adventureÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwhether itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs the quest of academic accomplishments, the thrill of sporting victories, or the first solo voyage into unfamiliar lands. Their days are rich with the pursuit of discoveries, both within themselves and in the world that beckons with open arms.

However, to claim that youth corner the market on life's joys is to overlook the profound and diverse expressions of happiness that manifest in latter years. Aging brings the opportunity to harvest the fruits of long labor, to bask in the richness of established relationships, and to indulge in the luxury of timeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂtime that was once a scarce commodity amidst the hustle of professional endeavors and familial duties.

It is in life's autumn where the wisdom culled from triumphs and tribulations gifts older adults the perspective to discern and appreciate life's subtler beauties. While their manner of joy may not resonate with the exuberance of youthÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs spirit, it is characterized by depth and a resonant appreciation for the nuances of existence.",P2,CHI,high,1
"While the assumption stands that young people inherently enjoy life more thoroughly than their older counterparts, this perspective neglects the layered dimensions of joy that can flourish at any stage of life. Fresh-faced and spirited, young people appear to have an insatiable appetite for life, seeking out exhilarating escapades, forging deep connections with peers, and relishing in the thrill of establishing their place in the world.

Those in the bloom of youth are often portrayed as living in a perpetual state of ascent, climbing towards their dreams without the weight of years lived and the intimations of mortality that come with age. To be young is to be at the forefront of change, to adapt rapidly, to innovate, and to sample lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs myriad offerings with a voracious hunger for what comes next.

Yet, there is more to life's enjoyment than the bright spark of youth's fireworks. Older individuals, with their rich tapestries of memories, can find a quieter, more refined joy in the simple pleasures that younger eyes might overlook. ItÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs in the well-trodden paths of a favored walking trail, the knowledgable fingers that play a piano's keys, and the shared glances that speak volumes in the company of long-time friends, where one may find an enjoyment that is as profound as it is understated.

In essence, to equate youth with a greater enjoyment of life is to underestimate the beauty of growing older, where the capacity for joy acquires new depths, informed by a lifetime of experiences.",P2,CHI,high,1
"The idea that young people enjoy life more than older people is an oversimplification that fails to take into account the diverse experiences and perspectives that influence an individual's enjoyment of life.

One could argue that young people are in the prime of their lives, often blessed with good health, less burdened by life's experiences, and prone to seek out excitement and adventureÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂall of which may translate to a high level of enjoyment. The novelty of youth offers a canvas of possibilities, and young individuals may eagerly partake in life's offerings, eager to enjoy and absorb every moment.

On the other hand, older people might be seen as having passed their prime and grappling with the challenges of aging, such as health concerns and the loss of loved ones, which could ostensibly diminish their delight in life. Yet, this perspective overlooks the ability of older individuals to take pleasure in life's moments with a depth of understanding and appreciation that often comes with age.

Furthermore, older adults can find a great deal of enjoyment in activities and relationships that they have nurtured over time. The joy derived from grandchildren, the achievement of personal goals, or the freedom that comes from retirement can provide deep satisfaction and enjoyment later in life.

In summary, while young people may appear to have a more visible vibrancy and assertiveness in their enjoyment of life, older individuals often find joy in the subtleties and breadth of their life experiences. It is not so much the age but the quality of the experiences and the attitude towards life that determines one's enjoyment.",P2,CHI,high,1
"Advocates of the joys of youth stress the vibrant allure of young individuals, emboldened by their prime, to extract the most from life's banquet. The fire of youth kindles adventures, romantic escapades, and the sheer expanse of possibilities that stretch out with the promise of relentless excitement.

Indeed, this exuberance propels young people to plunge headlong into life, energized by the physical vitality that supports the relentless pursuit of ambitions and sensory delights. This relentless craving for experience often yields heady tales of revelry, deep camaraderie, and a life lived at full throttle.

Contrastingly, the seasoned echelons of older generations may seem to trade the boisterous arenas of enjoyment for the quiet nooks of satisfaction. What the youth might misread as a retreat into the confines of age, is, in reality, an advance into the world of introspective leisure. This demographic finds a resonant joy in the legacy of a well-lived past and the capacity to impart wisdom to the burgeoning futures of the young.

Thus, while the contours of enjoyment may reshape with age, both young and old can claim their rightful place at the pinnacle of life's myriad pleasures, albeit via contrasting routes that converge at the summit of fulfillment.",P2,CHI,high,1
"At first glance, it appears quite evident that the scales of joy tip strongly in favor of youth. Young people are at the zenith of their physical prowess, their futures are mosaics of potential, and their relationships are often dynamic and evolving. Life to the young is like a fast-flowing river, filled with the rapids of excitement and the thrill of the unknown.

Engaging with the world with a boundless enthusiasm, the young throw themselves heartily into their passions. Be it technology, art, or social activism, they are often the vanguard for societal change and the face of generational hopes and ambitions.

Yet this narrative neglects the quieter, more entrenched forms of joy that are the hallmarks of older age. The map of an older individualÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs life is etched with many roads traveled, and the contentment derived from reflecting on a path well-trodden is a singular pleasure. Theirs is a joy rooted in continuity and legacy, found in the wisdom shared with younger generations and the satisfaction of long-term goals achieved.

With lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs climax behind them, older adults are privy to a landscape of enjoyment that is not only about personal gains but the simple act of living in accordance with oneÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs intrinsic values.

"Teenagers have always been the hope and the backbone of our society .
Just like the relationship between teachers and students , teenagers bares the burden of achieving greater success than their parents .
But does this mean that the older generation 's lives are easier and happier than young people ?
No , I neither agree or disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

First , we will talk about young people .
Nowadays , young people are the representation of our fast-changing society .
To most of them , life is a tideous fact which they cannot escape .
Faced with large amounts of academic studies in school , family pressure such as not fulfilling their demans to achieve good marks at school , and also family violence and the possibiliy of loosing a father or mother from a early divorce .
Young people today are also threatened with the corruption of our society .
Our media influences our young minds with movies , music , news and advertisements .
And what do young people learn from them ?
Violence , sex , dishonest , and many more unvirtous things .
A great example would be the increasing number of young gang members in our sociey .
Many of them were born and raised just like any other children , but the moment they turn on the 50 Cent rap songs , they are addicted .
Addicted not only by the beat of the music , but also corrupted by its contents .
Many of them began to immitate certain celebraties they adore without realizing whether the things they learn from these so-called `` artists '' are teaching them .
Some of them might even start walking the road towards crime .
So can we say that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
I do n't think so .

On the other hand , the older generation face new problems too .
Today , we live in a world with little or no morale contiousness .
In countires such as China , the old Confucianism which binded the traditional way of life is disappearing .
Children do not respect the elders no more , they can argue with rudeness , they can have sex before they get married , they can smoke in school , they can dress themselves like whores and criminals .
Although our governments have fundings for the old people when they retire , but that 's not what old people really want .
Most old people have experienced wealth , fame and love , they do not need elegant houses and expensive cars .
They just need a good physical and mental health .
And despite the little amount of money for any old person to live other than the medical fees , what they need is love , love and caring from their kids .
Statistics have shown that a lot of old people die of lonelyness and frustration other than physical illnesses .
All that said , do older people live better lives than young people ?
I think neither .

Finally , I conclude that neither young or old people have enjoy life more .
The young troubled with pressures within themselves , they are faced with social and family pressures .
The old are left alone and isolated from the rest of the society as if they are useless .
To improve the situation , I think the only solution is instead of wealth and fame , people should pay more attention to morale principles .

"Some people hold the opinion that young perople enjoy life more than older people do .
Others have the oppsite point of view .
This statement has caused a heat debate for a long time .
However , as far as I am concerned , I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , at least it 's the case in China .

Since China is still a developping country , so by comparaison with the western developed countries , like the USA or the France , the generation of my grand parents are normally not rich .
As a result , they do not travel a lot as their children do .
They prefer to save money for later use .
Consequently , most of the chinese old people , after their retirement , choose to stay at home every day instead of going out to enjoy life as their children do .

Also , there is a tradition in China that grand-parents look after their grand-children .
This situation is considered rather common in the society .
Consequently , you can find a lot of young couples go for a trip alone and leave their children to their parents .

However , let 's take a look at how the young people enjoy their life .
Firstly , the young people have more liberty as they are more energetic .
As I have mentioned above , the young people do not need to worry about their children even when they are away since it is a tradition that the grand-parents take care of the grand-children when the parents are not there .
And relatively , this young generation is richer than their parents are , so they choose to spend their money on enjoying their lives , going for a trip for example .

Secondly , it is so commun that you find numbers of young people in the cinema after work or during the weekend .
And they go to a bar with their friends after work , or go to a gymnasium during the weekends .
Since they are young and energetic , they know how to take advantage of their spare time and enjoy their life .
However , it is so rare to find old people in pubs or in gymnasiums in China .

Maybe that 's not the case in Europe or in the USA .
However , I find in China , it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Perhaps there will be a change in the near future ?

"Now I am at the later of 20s .
Combining my own experience and borrowing experiences of my friends in China , I tend to disagree with the statement .
In my point of view , both young and the older people knows the importance of enjoying life , however , young people are different from the older one in how frequency , what and why to enjoy life .

To start with , mostly young people enjoy life in a different pace from the older one .
I think this is one of the factors that mislead others believe that young guys are enjoying life more than the older ones .
During weekends or typical vacation seasons , we can easily find young men or women emerging almost every corners of trendy entertainment places , ranging from hot scenic spots to cute bars in the town .
On the contrary , older people are rarely found .
However , we have to understand more behind that .
These occassions are the best time for the young guys to go out since normally during the weekday , they have to spend time in the office from 800am to late as 800pm .
It should be more fair to conclude if we considered that it was also the young people who spent most of time during the weekday to work overtime .

Secondly , young people enjoy life in a variety of forms which are quite different from the older ones .
Activities such as reading , playing cards or Majiang ( a traditional Chinese game ) , or watching TV programs are favorite ones for older people .
However , nowadays , young people have different funs to enjoy .
They enjoy to have activities in a more lively and trendy form such as fitness exercise , hiking , drinking and sharing with friends in the bars .
Since those trendy activities are more publicized , it is easy to conclude that young people enjoy life more than the older ones .

Lastly , it is the different view toward life that determines the variance between young peope and older ones when they enjoy life .
Contrary to older people who more often view life and work are seamless connected in China , youngsters will treat life and work separately .
They understand that work is disconnected from life .
In some extent , a happy life is the basis for a successful work .
Therefore , it is critical to enjoy life to full when off work while to concentrate on work vice versa .

"For old people , they have experienced all kinds of events , delightful or frustrating , so the life has already been a past process .
In my opinion , what they should do is to review if and gain satisfactory from it instead of looking forward .
I definitely agree with this statement and below I would explain some of the reasons .

Every day , every hour , and even every minute , we , especially the young people , face a lot of problems either in work or at home .
Since the world is rapidly changing and modern life has became more and more complicated , there are a lot of pressures , also can be called pleasures , modern people can enjoy .
Obviously , old people can not catch this rapid social pace , it also implies that these great pleasure resulting from works or compete are more and more far away from the old people .

Internet , invented in last century , with its wide availabity and increasingly prosperous information supplies , has become one of the most powerful means of both communication and pastimes today in the history , and will be more and more difficult to ignore .
As it is so fashional that its user has been basically limited to the young people .
Yong people has active thoughts and strong curiosities .
These are essetial traits for enjoying the life .

Take the case of a thing that one of my neighbor family , having both a teenager member and a grandfather .
The boy are proficient in almost all kinds of modern facilities and seems to be obsessed with them .
While the grandfather , with a priority to these machines , but seldom to touch them .
The only entertaiment he enjoys was the boring radio .

"I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Personally , I think that people who are 60 or older would enjoy their lives much more that younger people , especially people who are between that age of 16 to 50 .
I agree the reason for being young is to have fun and enjoy life , but that does not mean that only young people can have fun , and older people would definitely have boring lives .
For example , my grandmother who live s in China is 70 years old , but I have never heard her coomplaining about her life is boring .
Even though she lives alone at home , but she still has her social life like I do .
She signed up for a ballroom dancing class at the local learning center , and goes there three times a week .
Since then , she has made many more friends , and because she is very good at dancing , she feels that is the place that she belngs to .
As for me , I have made friends in my school since i moved here , and I constantly Hang out with them .
Another reason I think that older people would enjoy life more than younger people is because most of the people who are 60 or older are retired , they do n't have to work anymore .
Which means they do n't have to deal with the all the pressure from work or schools , perhaps the relationships between co-workers and bosses .
I can see that every night when my parents come home from work , they always look exhausted , but they still have to cook , and finish the rest of their work after dinner .
They also have to face other problems such as morgages , bills , my college tuitions and more .
On the other hand , my grandmother , who is already retired , she does not have to worry about things like that , she can just relax and enjoy the rest of her life .
Therefore , I do not agree with the statement and I think that older people can enjoy their lives even more .

"Personally , i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This is because young people are more energetic , more healthy and have more adventures .

First of all , younger people tend to have stronger bodies ; they are full of energy .
They can play a lot of exciting sports .
For example , younger people can paly basketball , rock climbing , snowboarding and so on .
However , these kinds of sports will not be very good for elders because they tend to be tired very soon and they will not be able to enjoy themselves .
Moreover , younger people are able to recover very fast after big games so that they can be ready for their next activities .

In addition to being more energetic , yonger people are healthier .
They tend to have strong bodies because they are growing up instead of getting old .
Being strong has the advantages of enjoy their lives more .
For instance , young people can eat almost anything they want to eat such junk food .
This is because they do not have to worry about getting some disease .
On the other hand , older people have to worry about their diets all the time because they tend to have problem with illnesses such as diabetes .
Having healthy bodies truely are the big advantage for young people to enjoy their lives more .

Finally , younger people will have more adventures .
This is because they have more time than the elders do .
For example , younger people are able to change jobs once a year , and they are not worried because they can always find a job .
Even if in a labour work , younger people are fit .
They can at least make their ends come meet .
Most of all , they can spend their leisure time doing lots of activities such as travelling aroung .
As for older people , they may not have as much oppotunities as younger people do .
They have to be careful all the time and worry about losing their jobs .
And they definately do not have the time to explore our modern society .

"I agree with the condition , young people do enjoy life more than older people .
Not only because older people had lived longer , but also young people are more active .
Yet , young people like to try anything new , they are more willing to accept the changes of the world .

Because older people have lived longer , so they had try anything new during their `` younger life . ''
As they grow older , they are more mature , they know what is the most important in their life .
For example , a young man of age 18 will go to night club more often than a man who is 23 , the reason is because that the man knows there is just a place for rest and maye he needs to work on the next day .
On the other hand , the young man will think the night club is very fansy and fun , because there is lots hot girl or any other reason that attract his attention .
In this case young man knows how to release himself in a night club , but the man did not get rest totally in the club .

Young people are usually more active than the older people , because they have more energy , yet , they are easily to take attention on new things than the older people .
For examplel , lets say a 18 young man and a 25 man , they both like to read novels , but maybe the man would not to go to the store to rent it , and just have fun sitting there to read , or go online , do some novel search .
Oppositie , the young man may go to the store and sit there 4 hours just watching novels and enjoy in it .
Older people can not do anything they want freely , because they need to think more and they have to have the motivate to do it .

No matter what the change is , older people do not like it and they can not survive from it , but young people , even if they do not like the change , they can still survive from it .
For example , grandmother did not think that her granddaughter can go to school and married at age of 16 or 17 .
Different from the mother , she would let her daughter go to school , and to be educated , not marrying until the age of 28 , so then the grandmother would always complain to the mother that she should not let her daughter to go to school .

All in all , older people can not enjoy their life , not because they had lived what the young is living but because they are not as active as the young do .
Moreover , older people do not like anything new or to be changed , they are stuck in their own world .
Which is different from the young people , who is enjoy their life , play around , and try any new things .

"Now when looking around you , you can always find that young people indulging their interests in the video games , playing happily with their friends on the playgrounds .
While the senior spend most of their time just listerning to the radio or playing chess .
But do these phonmena suggest that the young people enjoy life more than older people ?
Never .

First , the young face far more pressure that the older people , both professionally and personally .
Today the commepetion in job market become more and more firece .
And aslo some of which become even more demanding .
They has to work hard to find a indeal job for themselves .
On the other hand , the pressure from personal life is aslo overwhelming , which mainly include the pressure form peers , from demaning parents .
All of this pressures make it diffilult for them to truly enjoy life .
While the older people has more opportunity to control their own life .
denefitly the older people rnjoy more in their daily life .

Second the young has more responsities to take .
THe young are the future of our socitey .
Aware of this , they even put pressure on themselves .
They have big ambition of shining , standing out .
Even additiced to video games is a sign they escape from the reality and aslo a sign that they suffer alot from life instead of enjoying it .
Tough even they themselves know they are wasting their time , they still want to give themselves a break .

In all , with all the pressure and responsibities , the younger people can never truely enjoy their life .

"As we know , young people are more energetic , enthusiastic , and enjoy better health , then it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
Personally speaking , I do not agree with such a contention .

First , the lives of young people are much more streassful than that of older people .
The generations of our parents or grandparents were born in the 1930s to 1950s , when the population in China was relatively small .
By contrast , most young people nowadays were born during the birth boost in 1980s , therefore , the competition for education opportunity and job positions are much more fierce for them .
They have to work day and night to support themselves financially .

Second , young people are in a specific phase of their lives when there are more troubles and frustrations than older people .
For example , young people would feel overwhelmed with anxiety or stress when first falling in love , when getting married , when expecting a baby , all of which are new to them , so that they are not sure whether they can handle .
However , the life for older people is more peaceful and smooth , without such anxieties .
What 's more , young people might probably have some financial problems , especially when they are frustrated in job hunting .
By contrast , most older people have pension and they are covered by social welfare system , such as Medcare , so that they are emaciated from such financial troubles and are living a more secured and decent life .

Third , older people are carefully protected and highly respected by the whole society , however , young people tend to be neglected in some way .
Nowadays , young people are encouraged or even forced to move out of their parents ' houses and begin an independent life by themselves .
Sometimes they are living in detachness , loneless and isolation .
By contrast , older people are respected by the whole soceity , and they are refrently visited by his children as well as social workers .
In numerous family get-togethers , it is not hard to tell how happy they are , with a pride of self-accomplishment .

In sum , although we must admit that young people are more health , energetic and enthusiastic than older people , at the same time , they are facing more stress , competition and anxiety .
What 's more , older people are carefully protected and highly respected by the whole society , but young people are negelected in some way .
Thus , I do not think young people are living a better life than older people .

"I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Firstly , I think that to enjoy life has nothing to do with the age .
Older people can enjoy life as much as young people do .
Sometimes older people even know more about how to enjoy life and enjoy life more because they are older than the young people and realize what is more precious to the life .
For example , when my mother was young , she wanted to earn more money and brought up the child in a big house .
She worked hard .
She had little time to stay with the children .
When she was old , the children all left and went to university in another city or even in another country .
She realized that she would have spent more time with the children when the children stayed at home if she had been young again .
Obviously nothing is more delightful and memorable than to enjoy yourself with your dear childrens .
There are also many examples that the young people regret the days that they would enjoy the life better .

Secondly , we have many ways to enjoy the life .
The ways are not better or worse .
They are not less or more .
Young people may want to dance , to sing , to skate or to climb the mountain .
Older people prefer reading , watching television or just watching the sunset by the sea .
During the different period in our life , we have different ways to enjoy life .
Life can be as active as a tiger and life can also be quiet and calm as a small river .
We enjoy life in the different period .
When we are young , we want to challenge and to take risk .
When we are older , we can enjoy the peacefulness and normal happines in the life .

In a word , I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
It is not a question of age .
In fact , it is a question of attitude .
We can enjoy life in any stage of our life as long as we know how to appreciate the beauty of the life and to cherish what we have possessed .

"With the rapid growth of our civilization , more and more people start paying attentions to enjoy their lives .
Indeed , with the passing of time , the meaning of life starts to change .
many people realize that health is not equal to wealth .
Moreover , we are standing on the crossroad .
In this turning point , young people enjoy life more than old peolpe do because young people intend to do a varity of sports , experience less pressure from the society , and obtain the tendency to try something new .

It is no doubt that many sports are for young people .
With the upcoming of Beijing olympic 2008 , many sports are introduced at the same time .
My daily experence is a good example of this , I went to ski last month in Vancouver .
When I was standing on the top of the mountain , I rarely see any older people around .
In fact , it is estimated that there are more than 500 unique sports in the world .
Therefore , there are so many sports for young people to attand today ; however , at the same time , there are so few sports for old people to attend .
perhaps the only sport I can think of is Yoga .
To be brief , when doing a sport , young people have more choices than older people do .

Besides , young people have less pressure from the society .
in this comptetive society , all the parents in the world intend to keep their children from danger .
On the other hand , some of the parents are trying really hard making money so that they would have a better life after the retirement .
Conversely , many young people think they have grown up .
Moreover , they do not feel the pressure from the society .
Therefore , they intend to enjoy their life more than their parents do .

Moreover , young people have the tendency to try something new than old people .
There is a sport called `` ultimate jumping '' . young people need to jump from a mountain or someplace very high with a rop tied on their feet .
I have a friend called Jimmy .
He is crazy about this kinds of sport , and he was extremely happy after he jumped because it gives him a chance to relax .
Therefore , young people intend to try something new to enjoy their life .

With all the aspects considered above , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
In my opinion , young people think better than older people do because they know that health is important than wealth .
",P2,CHI,high,0
"From my personal experience and those of people around me , I strongly disagree with the opinion that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
First of all , in order for one to really enjoy something , such as life or any kind of sport , he/she must first know what it truly is .
When people say that they really enjoy doing something the first time they are doing it , what they really mean is that they like , rather than enjoy , doing it .
When people getting older , they see the rise and down of the life , and they have a better idea about what life is and what the most important thing is in their lives .
I think such a deep understanding about the life is exactly the prerequisite for anyone to enjoy it .
After all , how can one really enjoy something when he has little or no ideaabout it ?

Secondly , when people become older , they have more things to appreciate and enjoy .
For example , family might mean much less for a young man than going to the party and hangging out with friends .
However , as people mature , they see their responsiblities they owe to people around them and those they love and cherish .
They could still go out to the party and play with friends , but they also have some truly enjoyable thing that most young people do not know to appreciate , such as family .

Certainly , there are many interesting things that can said to be franchise to young people .
For example , while many youngsters are fascianted about the extreme sports , there are a significantly lower percentage of older people who would dare to try .
Their health conditions might not allow them as well .

In conclusion , I disgree with the assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe that the following modification would be more appropriate : `` Young peple experience life , but older people enjoy life . ''
",P2,CHI,high,0
"`` Enjoy life ! '' has been one of most popular sentence used by the people today .
Different people have different explanation about enjoying life and have different ways to enjoy their own lives .
The elder would like to drink some tea , or to chat with some friends to enjoy their lives , on the contrary , young people would like to do something that is never be tried by themselves to enjoy their lives .
In most of the time , young people enjoy life more than older people do .

First of all , young people can get new imformation quickly and accept new materials easily than older people do .
Nowday , more and more new products , new objects are developed continuely which make the world colourful and beautiful .
The one who can accept the new materials and can adopt the materials at the first time will be the one who can enjoy his/her life .
For example , MP4 player has been developed recently , and many young people have bought MP4 player to enjoy musics , songs , and vedios .
However , older people seem not acceptable to these electronical products .
In short , it makes young people to enjoy their life fully to get the new imformation and products as quickly as they can .

Secondly , young people always try to do something that they have never done .
Life is consist of many unknown factors , happenings , and activities .
Addmittedly , it is not so safe to try something that is unknown such as tring to eat a kind of sea food that has not been eaten ever before .
However , there will be more amazing feelings when trying something new .
Take sports for example , cannon trail is a popular sports among the young which will be a risk in some level .
It can be said this sports make the life full of risk and fun .

Finally , the most important factor is that young people need n't have to take care of family , children or even need n't handle with everyday work .
They have plenty of time to do what they want to do .
In another word , they have plenty of energy to enjoy their lives .
It is most important factor that lets them enjoy life more than older people do .

"I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of several reasons .
In general , it is because that young people nowadays have so more much responsibilities than they did in the past .
First , they are expected to achieve academic success .
This means that middle school and high schoolers have tremendously pressure in school because they are expected to get straight As and do all the community works in hope to get into their ideal colleges .
Second , young people have tremendous peer pressure in school .
This is true particularly as many of them strive to fit in by wearing the right clothes and using the right terms .
Thirdly , after finishing their education , which is generally expected to be a minimum of a bachelor 's degree from a considerably respectable university or college , they are expected to find a job with decent amount of salaries .
Ideally , because of the way Hollywood protraits the so-called `` American dream , '' they should be able to buy a big house , own a couple of nice cars , and start a family .
Thirdly , after getting their first jobs , they have to work day in and day out and at the same time deal with pressures of uncertainties in their future , including the possibilities that they might never be successful in their careers or could even lose their jobs .

On the other hand , older people that retired from their works are much more at ease with their lives .
First , they have a peace of mind because they have already done most of the challenging tasks in life , including school and work .
Second , their daily schedules are much simpler are less task-oriented .
Rather constantly worrying about getting done with the next thing to study for or attend to , they can just enjoy life and be without the pressure to keep up with a schedule .
As going to museums , listening to concerts , taking a walk on the street , day dreaming , or reading simply for enjoyment are part of their daily activities , they can simply enjoy life for the beauty of its simplicity .

"Older people have a lot of responsibilties they have to attend to and undertake .
However , young people have everything provided to them by their parents .
Young people led carefree lives .
Thus young people are able to enjoy life more than older people do .

older people are constantly worried about maintaining their job so they can support their families .
Older people also have to take care of their children .
older people are busy every minute of their lives .
If they are not at work then they have to clean the house and cook dinner for their families .
Older people also have to take the education and future of their children into thier own hands .
The older people are have to help the children with their homework or make sure the children finishe their homework .
Above all , the older people have to constantly work to afford the thing their children desire and spend their free time with the children and bond with them .
As a result , the older people are giving up their only free time for the younger people .

The young people are not tied down by the same responsiblities as the adultd .
The young people only have the responsibilites of school and maybe cleaning their room .
As a result , they have more free time to play and do the thing they enjoy .
After compeleting thier homework the young people can go to the movies with friends or do anything they like .
The young people do n't have to work to gain anything .
When young people need anything , such as meals and money , they are provided by the parents .
They have a house to live , in contrast to older people who have to worry about eraning money to afford a house .

Older people are less able to enjoy life because of responsibilites .
They are at constant motion to full fill them .
But , the young people are more blessed .
Parents support threm with many things they needed in life .
The young people have their parents to fall back on when they are in trouble .

",P2,CHI,high,0
"I do n't agree with that statement .

In my opinion , enjoying life does n't relate to the age directly .
Of course , usually a young person can make an advantage of his youthful and healthy body .
He can do more extreme sport activities , like snowboarding , surfing or bumgee-jumping .
But more often young people are not that independent as they wish to be .
Most young people need financial support from their parents , especially during the studying time at unversity .
That means one has to explain the expediture exactly to the parents every time one needs money .
That can be very exhausting and demotivating .

After university , financial worries decrease on the one hand , but on the other hand concerns on the job arise .
As a rule , the first years on the job are the most stressful ones which are accompanied by immense pressure to establish oneself in the new company .

Thus , I think that the thirty-somehows can enjoy life better than the younger people .
Those people usually have already gained acknowledgement in the job world and in society .
Moreover , they are financially independent and do n't have to fight for the career that intensly .
As a result , that group of people can spend more time for their hobbys and their family .

Older people are also enjoying life , because they have more experience .
I think they know how to appreciate the real things and values in life and are more confindent .

"Older people always say that young people are always busy with making money and doing their job , which prevent the young people to enjoy their life .
I admit that older people , especially those people who retire , have much more time to enjoy their life .
However , since the young people are healthier than the older man , there is no limitation to young people 's activities .
Furthermore , young people have much more entertainment than the old ones and young people can more easily communicate with others and chat with others .
Therefore , I think young people can enjoy the life better .

First , young people is healthier than the older ones .
It means that young people can travel to any place which interests them .
For example , they can climb to the top of famous mountains , sail into the ocean and walking into the middle of rain forest .
Moreover , They can also play basketball and football with each other while older people will get very tired in the competitaion games .
Therefore , young people can enjoy life more than old ones becuase they are healthier than the older ones .

Second , young people have much more entertainment than those of the older ones .
Young people can go to bars and restaurants after work .
They chat with friends and enjoy the delicious food such as Chinese food and Mexigan food in the restaurants while older ones will prefer to stay at home and being alone .
Furthermore , the young people can have dating with their girl/boy friends .
They watch movies , listen to the performance in the concert and go to see the beautiful landscape together .
Young people can even have fun by playing the same mmo games such as world of warcraft .
They form guilds in the game and they meet in the game and play game together .
Thus , young people can enjoy their life more than older ones becuase they have much more entertainment .

Third , young people enjoy communicating with each other in the internet .
Many young people enjoy chatting with their friends with msn or other softwares .
They can tell jokes to their friends when they are working in the office .
Those jokes can make their office hours more interesting .
Furthermore , even when two young people are far in distance , they can easily talk with each other .
They just need to have a computer and they can put on the microphone and use the network services to talk .
Those examples show that young people enjoy their life better than the old ones by talking with others more easily .

In conclusion , though older people have much leisure time than the young ones , they are so confined by their health and their life style which limits them to have more entertainment and communicate frequently with others .
Thus , young people are beneficial from their healthy , their various entertainment and their communication with others .

But in this more and more competitive society , even the new challeging and new experience of this world are no longer appearling as some old people may think , when compared to the high pressure we young adults received .
All the pressure : competition with classmates , competition with colleagues , and high pressure of taking care of a new family .

Competition in schools-from elementary school all the way to graduate level , now is heavy like no other period .
Everyone around seems like genius .
And even worse , the parents realise it .
The kids as aerly as only 3 or 4 years old , many are forced to go to take courses on piano , maths or professional athelet .
They live in the competition and do n't have the chance to play with the other kids , or to spend a whole weekend afternoon in the playground .
It actually has caused a lot of psychological problem of those kids .
For a deploma from a prestige college , many kids ca n't stand the high standard from the teachers and parents and commit suicide .
In my opinion , it wo n't be a life enjoyble for these students .

The recent time that I know the deadly competition for empolyment , is when talking to a 82 years old granny I met in a local park .
She told me she was very satisfied with her life now .
But the only thing she keep concering of is the work of her children .
One of them have a undergraduate degree , but cannot get a work with $ 60 USD a month .
The insurance is problem , the house rent is a problem , even the food becomes a main concern .
This probelm is facing many young adults , especially those who just go into the professional area .

Teenage mom is no longer news , and it thoroughly reflect a social problem when solving the family issue of young adults .
Most high school dropouts , if it 's not for the study problem , it 's the teenage moms .
They give birth to a new life , but also sacrifice their life to receive better education and better occupation .
Another feature odf modern society , is the age of newly marriage couple are getting older and older .
Everybody seems lost in the work , and rarely have time or energy to face the marriage and commitment .
Many guys in their 30s , do n't know anything about women , is no longer somthing rare , too .

So does age .
Different age-experiences enable us to interprete the codes of life , the different primes in life , the dynamic enjoyments by walking through life .
Hence , I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe different age groups can experience the identical happiness or joy by appreciating the different beauty inside of their life .

First of all , it is believed that all ages have its prime .
20s means smartness and quickness , 30s encountering diligence and perseverence , while 60s sounds sophistication and wisdom .
They just focus on different strength .
It does not deny or differ their enjoyment in life .
Many Nobel Prize winners who achieved their biggest professional peak , enjoy the happiness of it when they are wellknown and prestigious in their later years .
They had a particularly hard time in proving their hyposis or theory in their youth , like Albert Einstein , Nikola Tesla .

Secondly , happiness is a lifetime pursuit .
People through all age bracket seek for the real joy of life .
Many sayings tell us the happiness does not discriminate ages .
A wise , intelligent novel or person can win high praise despite of the age of the author .

Furthermore , many people think the life is too short to waste .
So , during their youth , most of their endeavors contribute their career , family and friendship .
While , retired people can enjoy their interest , develop their skills since they got more free time .
Can we say that only young people enjoy a better life than older one .

In my oppinion , I think it depends .

Different people have different point of views of life .
That is the most curcial reason why I think it depends .
We can not simplily decide which enjoys better .
To illustrate , when I was little , I used to live near the coast , my grandmother often take me to the beach and tell me about her life and things she felt happy about .
I can feel the love and pure joy .
We had a great time .
I can tell from my feelings and her smiles that we are all enjoying our life at that moment .
We can feel the joy and happiness from the bottom of our hearts .
I do not think I can tell the difference between our joyfull giggles .
Thus , I can not tell who enjoys life more .

We face various situations everyday .
How we feel about these eveyday problems effects our feelings towards life .
As some of the old peoples have come across many hardtimes their whole life , they seem to look blue everyday .
Some complains about the community frequently , the others often sit together and gossip about other people 's business .
They never look satisfied and always feel dull .
To me , I do not think they enjoy their life .
They do not seem to understand the meaning of life -- to be confident and always believe that tomorrow is another day .
When ever I see a little joyful kid passing by a old lady with unsatisfiction in her eyes , I constantly believe that in some case , youth enjoy life more than eld .

Nowdays thousands and thousands of youth are addicted to the internet , durgs , and all kinds of harmful things like that .
They think they are estactic when they are doing the wrong things .
Are they enjoying life as they think they are ?

As all known well , young people have more energy than the old , and they are full of imagination and creation .
They regard life as a more colorfull way than the older do .
Take school teachers for example , a large quantities of them says they love thier vocation as teaching .
A main reason for this is that they are exposed to young people , whose thoughts are fresh and lives are lively .
Teachers are obsessed by the joyness of young people .
By living with them , teachers are sometimes find themselves back in thier young pirod .

Besides , when off campus , young people have more purchasing ability than older people , so the amount of money they spend in varied typed of recreation are larger than order people spend .
For young people , they are more likely to obtain the happiness through buying new clothes , shoes , movies as well as eating out in fine restaurant with friends .
With the supplying of money , they can realise enjoy their life in such ways .
What 's more , the internet seems more attractive to young people than the older .
Young people enjoy sufing in the internet including chating with thier friends and even by web-camara .
In this way they enjoy life more than older people do .

Last but not the least , the society gives more oppurtunities to enjoy their lives to young people .

"This may be true in the past , but not present .
Today older people enjoy life more than young people do in China .
Why ?
It because that people 's point of views have changed a lot and young people generally have a lot to do .

As competition for the chances of getting higher is more and more intense , young people have to study hard and spend most of their time on campus .
Take my nephew as an illustration .
He is a high school student and will graduate next year .
How long does he study every day ?
You may not believe in it , but it is true that he spends 16 hours per day studying .
With such a heavy course load , do you think he could enjoy life ?
Is this case an individual ?
Of course not !
My nephew told me that all his classmates studied in that way when I asked him that why he studied so hard .
What about young people who have graduated from college ?
They are no exceptions !
They have to work hard to go to graduate school or find a job .
Neither would give them a break .
Today , it is quite common for young people even not to have time to go steady .
For most of young people , they surely do not have time to enjoy On the contrast , older people have a lot of time to enjoy life since they have retired from work .
As their sons or daughters have married , they are free from duty now .
They could travel around China or even around the world .
They spend time watching and experiencing new things .
Also , they can play games and watch films .
What is more , they even can do everything ( Of course , legal things ) , as long as they want to do so , since they have time .
Every morning , I can see a lot of old people enjoying activities when I pass by a park .

The changing of People 's views toward old people also contributes to the fact that old people can enjoy life more than young ones .

They can do everything calmly and happly , they will happy to teach the young people the proper ways that live in the world .
They have so many nice memories that happened in their past life , even meeting with failure , they will become more wiser and sophysicated .

Secondly , Old people have little stress from the society .
In the advancing technology society , with the advent of new technology and discovery , young people feel the great stress in the society , they must advance their knowledgy and technology level to fit with the fast pace of the society .
They should work hard to make money and not be dropped out by the peers in the intense competition .
However , the older people have no stress , Also they will benefit from the advanced society .
because they have accomplished the task and have more time to share the achivement they made in their young times .
They can do fishing and travele by airport not just spend more time on train as past , they will communicate with their friends on Internet , not must to write a letter that will arrive at their friends after a few days .
They will have the happiness to teach their granddaughters .

Of course , the young people has so many enjoyment in this world .
Their curiousity make them to discover new things .
It is so wonderful to taste the different foods in differend country and feel the different culture in other countries far away from the country they live in .
They have the energy to climb the mountains that abundant their adventure experience in their lives .
They have so many chance to see the change of the world .

In summary , Older people will enjoy the wonderful world in their ways , and young people will also find so many interesting things continuesely in the world .

"In life there are many events that people do to enoy themselves .
Some people go to vacations while some without that much money could go to theme parks and ride on roller coasters .
To me , I think young people do actually enjoy life more than older people do because they have the energy that could be used to enjoy life better .
Young people would go to places like amusement parks , watch a movie with friends , hang out with friends and much more while older people mostly stay home .
Young people tend to go out more to have a good time with their friends .

When young people go to amusement parks , they have a great time .
Many go on the roller coasters and have a nice time screaming their lungs out or they go and ride on the regular rides like the carousel .
But to older people , roller coasters are very scary and sometimes caused them to have nausea .
Older people would shy away from the amusement park at much as they could .
At one time , my aunt came with me , her son and daughter to the amusement park .
Her son and I went to ride on the roller coaster while my aunt and her daughter just sat there and waited for us .
She did not have much fun .
We asked her to go on the slower rides like the carousel with us but she refused so , we just gave up on her and went on some more rides at the amusement park .
At the end of the day , my aunt 's son and I enjoyed the amusement park more than my aunt and her daughter .

To a young person , going to watch a movie with friends is a very enjoyable hobby .
When watching with friends , they could laugh together about funny science in the movie and cry together when there was a sad scene .
But to an older person , they seldomly go to movies .
Like my parents , they do not go to movies .
I remembered when my sister , me and my mother when to the movies , she got bored and fell asleep .
She did not enjoy the movie and just slept through it .
My and my sister was kind of depressed because she slept through the movie .

Young people enjoy more in parties than older people .
Young people in parties could dance , eat , socialize , and have more fun than older people .
Older people could dance , eat , and socialize but they would not enjoy as much because they do not have as much energy .
At a party at my friend 's house , we had lots of fun .
We ate , watched television , sang karaoke , and danced .
Some of the people danced and sang very funny so , we laughed really hard and had a great time .
We spent almost all of out energy and enjoyed every bit of it .
In an adult party , the part that was most fun was eating food .
There were not many entertainment and most of the adults just stood in their own corner and socialized .

Young people do have more fun and enjoy themselves than older people .
Most of the older people would get away from all the places the young people tend to like .
The older people would want to mostly stay home and relax while the young people would go outside and have a great time with their friends .
They do not have as much energy as the young people to enjoy life like us .

"Some people claim young people live a more valuable and interesting life than the older people do .
The other people , however take the opposite point of view .
In my opinion , I believe older people can enjoy life more than young people do .
I shall set forth two major reasons in support of this .

Firstly , older people normally know the meaning of life better than the youth .
They have richer life experiences and from which they have learnt what kind of things are worth doing .
In this way they are more likely to spend their time on the pursuits more valuable .
By pursuing these precious goals , their life are full of meaning and have more fun than some young `` couch potatoes '' who do not know where they should go .
For an instance , I used to live with an old lady for a while .
She was eighty years old , but she kept making baby clothes everyday for the children in orphanage .
She considered it as considerably valuable , and thus she greatly enjoyed the way she lived her life .
So older people gain more life experiences through years and generally know deeper about the meaning of life , which brighten their life .

Secondly , young people are more likely to enjoy their life in more superficial way .
It is easy to see that a lot of teenagers indulge in video games and TV programs which keep them from sophiscated thinking .
They are easily attracted by superficial pleasures and the life they enjoy is less valuable than the life with deliberate considerations and long-term plans which older people normally make .

In brief , older people can live a more meaningful life and thus enjoy life with higher quality than some young people do .
Therefore , from my point of view , older people can live a more joyful life than young people do .
",P2,CHI,high,0
"In my point of view , I agree that young people enjot life more that older people do .
Young as the people are , they receive information more quickly than the older .
Thus , when they they want to enjoy their life they have more ideas , more passion , and more creativity .

Firstly , nowadays , each time we receive a piece of new information we hold a new idea .
Providing that we do n't have the internet we ca n't enjoy mass media resources .
The older people are not able to enjoy them due to the limit of the knowledge of the internet .
Young people dive into the ocean sea for the sakes of the new technology , imagining that if young people ca n't get the new idea they wo n't do that .
However , the old people may not or dare not .

Secondly , I think young people have a strong passion for life .
They dream for their future .
As being in the young group , I always plan my bright future no matter what problems I encounter , thus I am getting ready for anything to happen in the next minute .
I do n't think the old people are willing to accept all that is not pleasant .
Life is full of unperdiction and I think the best way to enjoy it is to enjoy the unknown things happening .
We are passionate enough to face the life .

Thirdly , life should be around with creativity .
There is impossibile that a lot of things such as romantic things , surprising things are supposed to happen to us without our creativity .
I think the young people are more creative than the older ones .
If we want to enjoy the life it ca n't be emphasized any more that creativity is required .
A lot of family problems is caused by less creativity .
Therefore , our young people should take the advantage of holding various creavitity to enjoy life .

Life is enjoyed with passion , creativity , and ideas .
Young people , as the majority part of society , should do it better that the older people .
",P2,CHI,high,0
"Personally speaking , I totally disagree with this statement .
First of all , I think young people do n't have the enough time to enjoy their lives .
For example , young people , no mater where they are , will have to spend major of their time and energy `` starting '' their lives instead of enjoying their lives .
They have to spend 8 or more hours working everyday and even work overtime on weekends .
And I am not surprised to see young people working like dogs .
As a result , they are short of time to enjoy their lives .
While on the contrary , old people , on a large part , have retired from their work .
So understandably , with all the time available , they can set out to enjoying their lives either by staying at home and watching TV all day without worrying about the work load or traveling around the world to different places .

Second , young people do n't have the necessary amount of money to enjoy life .
Because the majority of young people 's income is spent to support the whole family and to maintain their competitive advantages in their own fields by often taking up some training programs , they barely have any extra money to enable them to enjoy life .
However , with all the saving the old people have made during all those years and no further need for them to get promoted , they can safely begin to enjoy their lives in whatever way they want to enjoy .

Finally , with the demand of their work and their family , young people never get around to thinking about how they can enjoy their lives and the fact that they do n't exactly know what life is , due to their limited life experience , has enormously deterred young people to enjoy their lives to the greatest extent .
But on the other hand , old people have experienced a lot in their own life course , they well know what life is and how they can enjoy it and consequently , old people enjoy life more than young people do .
",P2,CHI,high,0
"Some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Other people disagree with the statement .
Personally , I think that young people do enjoy life more than older people do for several reasons .
Young people have more strength , hope , and friends .

First of all , young people have more physical strength than older people do .
For example , young people can go swimming in summer , and go skiing in winter .
However , older people , such as people around eighty , cannot swim or ski anymore due to their physical strength .
Especially , sports like skiing are dangerous to them .
If they fall off , they might break their bones since they are not strong enough as they used to be .
Furthermore , young people can travel around and walk whole day long .
When young people go to other countries to travel , they can go to many places and enjoy the place as much as possible ; however , older people easily get tired and cannot move around as young people do .
They spend their time in hotel which is not very exciting .

In addition to having physical strength , young people have hope and dream toward their future .
For instance , young people study hard and try their best in order to achieve their dreams .
Even though they face some difficulties , they do not give up .
Young people have bright futures ; therefore , they put their effort into everything to create and change their futures .
On the other hand , older people cannot change their futures that much anymore .
They get up and eat and go to bed again .
Their daily life cycle would not change anymore .
Therefore , i think their life is much more boring than young people 's .

Lastly , young people have more chances to get to know many people , and they can make many friends who surely make their lives more exciting .
For example , when they go to school , there are many classmates , and when they go to company , there are many co-workers .
All the people they meet definitely have some influence on them .
When they have something happy , they can share their happiness to other people .
Furthermore , when they have some difficulty with anything , people around them might be able to help them .
Young people learn important things from people around them as they grow up .

It is clear that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
They know how to entertain themselves by having more strength .
They know how to create better lives with hope by working hard .
They are influenced and inspired by many friends and people around them .

"Nowadays , whether young people enjoy life more than older people do is a prevalent topic which has been widly debated .
Two different views exist to support or oppose .
After considering several aspects , I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more .

First of all , yong people have a strong study ability to learn new things around them .
For example , computer is a new technology product in nowadays , young people prefer to go on line for fun , buying things on internet and making friends on it .
Because they think it may save a lot of time and money .
However , the oler people may prefer to live in a traditional way , since they do n't want to change their life style after living under the same one for ten or twenty years .
That 's why they do n't want to taste the new things , though they are good .

Second , young people have much more energy than older people have .
The young people may often go to climb mountains and make a hike with their friends to see the beautiful flowers , blue sky and green sea .
And after a long walk or traveling , they may recover quickly and go on with another adventure .
By contrast , the older people do n't have this advantage .
Since they are old , their phisycial condition is not as well as used to be .
They can just stay at home to watch TV or have fun near where they live .
Therefore , older people 's life is limited .

Last but not least , the young people are much more creative .
When they see something new or interesting , they may think of a lot of question related , such as why it is so cute or how they make it .
After considering about these questiones , they may go to liberay and disscus with the friends for more details , and then they will try to improve it , create a better one .
The young people enjoy thinking new things .
But the older people may not be so active , because they have a lot of experiences .
They may judge things according to their experience and compare the question with the situation that they familiar with .
Therefoer , we can always hear that old people complained about the boring life .

From what have been talked above , we may safely draw a conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
",P2,CHI,high,0
"Some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
Other people believe in the other way which is older people have a more enjoyable life than young people .
As far as i concern , the latter is more reasonable than the idea mentioned earlier for the following reasons .

In the first place , young people have more responsibilities , which would allow them have less time to enjoy the wonderful things in their lives , than elderly , As a older people , in a sense , there is no duty , such as rising a child , paying taxes , and educate the next generation ; on the contrary , these responsibilities are , now , weighted on the shoulders of younth .
They need to worry about many things , including how to hold their jobs .
And it is also the truth that an increasing amount of time is being spent in the work place in order to hold the position they hold now .
That means less and less time will be available for them to enjoy the life .

In the second place , older people have a more peaceful mind to enjoy the life .
These is a growing tendecy for people to lose their ambition as their age is going up .
Comparing to the young people , elderly feel more comfortable with the life they are having now ; unlike older people .
young people are always on the way to seek something better , something they think deserve better .
This makes them always on the process of chasing , leaving no mind or mood the enjoy the life they are having now .

Finally , older people can do numberous things that young people are not able to do .
With the repect for older people taking more and more important place in an increasing number of people , people now build many places only for old people , and make more entertainments for the older .
These programme are more suitable for elders .
That 's reason some of the shows can not be understood by the young people .

All in all , young people cant not enjoy their life as much as older people do beacuse they are having less time , and ambitous mind to chase others thing .
In addition , they ca n't understand something that elders do .
However , i believe that in the future , young people will enjoy life in a same amount that older people do .

"I disagree with this point of view .
Nowadays with the fast development in medical field , social environment and the advanced concept towards the good old days , more and more older people are enjoying the pleasure of the daily life and the proportion of older ones keep on rising in recent years .
Older people as well as young people are enjoying the improving life .

First , I think older people have more leisure than young people .
Young people have to struggling to get enough money to maintain a life in the daytime and go on to study in the night colleges and other training system , which provide them with the technics necessary for their work .
In contrast to them , old people do n't need to go to the company everyday to strive for money due to the funds supplied by the government and they do n't need to be punished by bosses for not finishing the work properly .
What they need to do is just to lie in the sofa , watching TV or go to meet the former companions and call on at friends ' houses .
What a wonderful life !

Second , older people gain happiness by thinking about what they have acheived during the adult time .
But the young have no time to consider this and they are experiencing failure everyday .
Therefore , they are surrounded by pains , sorrows and any ohther unpleasant things , which constantly appear .
The older have no risk to compete with others , leaving the young people to be engaged in the competitive world .

Last but not least , the old ones enjoying the care given by their sons or duaghters .
In China , every child , when growing up , must commit the responsibility to look after their parents .
Their children will bring money , fruit or other wonderful things to the old but they themselves have to spend time teaching their own little chdren .

As the whole environment is improving rapidly , More and more older people will realize what an excellent life we have received .

"Since the technology is getting more and more advanced , people 's lives improved a lot .
Now people wo n't only think about how to make lives , instead , they will think about how to make their lives better .
More and more entertain are requested , and people start to enjoy their lives by having entertainment .
About the question whether young people enjoy life more or older people do , in my opinion , it depends on different people 's perspectives and different stages they are at .
This essay will discuss this issue by showing different people 's point of view .

For those people who are still going to elementrary school , they do n't even know what their life will be like .
They have flexible schedule ; and most of their time is spent on playing .
If this is also called a way to enjoy life , then the little kids express their enjoyable by enjoy playing .

After a person is in the high school , he may has some ideas about what direction his life will be like .
Teenagers are the generation who really know how to play the technology .
There is a fact that the people who know how to use computers are most teenagers .
Even though they have to study at school most of the time , they still have a lot of after school activities .
Teenagers are the ones who know how to hold a party the most ; also they are the customers who go to movie theatres often .
Teenagers enjoy their lives by spending time on parties , watching movies .
They are the ones who know how to use entertainment .

When people start their careers , obviously they do n't have enough time to do entertainment , but they still enjoy lives .
After finish the whole day 's work , they choose to relax themselves by watching tv , or playing sports , or listening to music .
As long as they feel relax , not as stress as working , they will know how wonderful their lives are .

Now it 's time to see how old people enjoy their lives .
Maybe some people will think that they are too old to enjoy life , well , it 's not true .
Because the society is improving , people start to care old people more .
There are a lot of places only for old people , and there are a lot of sports instruments for them to practice .
Old people like to get together and talk about their life in the past , and sometimes they will make up music bands , which some people at other age enjoy the most .

Based on the discussion above , it is easy to figure out that people at all ages enjoy their lives .
The only difference is they enjoy lives by different ways .
There might be some cases that some people always feel depressed and they do n't like their life , but in most of the situation , I think people will prefer to be happy .
As long as people feel positive about their daily , they will enjoy .

"Portrayed by enormus poets and artiests , life and the joys of life are so attracting as well as noble to everyone .
Lives of young people are appriciated as being vigorous and vivid , while older people are admired for having wiser speculation and richer experiences in life .
But who , after all , enjoy life better ?
In my point of view , young people tend to enjoy life more .

First and foremost , curiosity is a rather important factor in the enjoyment of life .
Young people , just like other young animals , possess enough curiosity to urge them exploring this world with discovering eyes and open hearts , which in turn rewards young people of an endless advanture of new archievements .

Another reason , perhaps equally crucial , is the fact that young people always have more physical capability than older people do .
Far too often can we see young people mastering all kinds of exciting sports and engage themselves with thrills .
By contrast , what we can frequently hear from the older people is simply the complaints like , `` If only I was 20 years younger. '' or `` God bless my heart . ''
.

Of course , older people do have their own advantage in enjoying life .
The aboundant experience accumulated along with life span enable them to taste life in a slower , yet maybe wiser pace .
But also undeniable is the pitiful truth that they often do n't have adequate energy and passion to keep up with the fast tempo of time .
They will more probably take a rest from time to time and doze over where young people enjoy their precious youth with no reversion .

`` Old people have a glorious past after them , while young people have a brilliant future before them . ''
This quote has addressed the problem in a neat and sentimental way .
With far more planty time and novel futures ahead , young people will almost definitely enjoy life better .

"With the development of society , there are increasing choices to enjoy life as people can play computer games , chat on line , or go to see a live performance etc .
Although these all seem to be what only young people can do as they accept new inventions and opinions more quickly and have more energy to enjoy , it is a little bit haste to assert that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Does young people really have more time and energy to enjoy life ?
As the pace of modern society fastens , young people who have already had a job face the pressure from their bosses , family members and other people , worrying about not getting promoted without recommendation , being troubled by a tiny mistake during the work and therefore making great efforts to work in the hope of completing their tasks perfectly .
As a result , they always keep in a hurry to get things done and seldom have energy to enjoy their life .
What 's more , for the young people who are still college students , the fierce competion when hunting a job also drives them to study hard and develop many kinds of skills .
For example , in the college I am studying in , most of students are striving to get certificates in business English and computer skills and taking a lot of courses such as communication skills , which may be helpful in future career .
In contrast , as older people do n't have to face all the challenges , risks and difficult choices , they tend to have a more peaceful mind and enjoy life more than young people .

Some people also argue that the modern technology such as computer skills used in many methods to relax makes it hard for older people to enjoy .
In fact , many old people have been accustomed to taking adavantage of these innovations .
For example , my grandfather who is 60 years old have been good at chatting on line and downloading movies and music from Internet just like a young person .
And also , old people can enjoy life in different ways without technology .
They can take a walk and take exercises in a park , or listen to music sitting in a chair , and for some of them , looking at grandchildren being around is a kind of relaxation .

"Differences between generations have been public concerns , even put into debates for a long time .
Among which there exists a widely discussed one - whether young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Needless to say , the answer varies from person to person .
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the above statement not only because young people appreciate diversity more , but also because they are more welcome to new things .

To begin with , with the development of human civilization , especially now globalization is an undeniable trend , diversity is increasingly acceptable and admired .
There are examples everywhere .
Young people , generally speaking , enjoy traveling to different places .
They are fascinated by diverse cultures and people they meet .
However , older people tend to stay in one place , and even hate changes .
In that case , their enjoyments are not comparable to their young counterparts .

In the second place , in contrast to older people. , young generation are more willing to accept novelties and enjoy them .
For instance , a couple of days ago , I was in the roller coaster in Bejing Amusing park .
It is an exciting experience , a challenge both pysically and mentally .
However , my parents just looked away and would not give a try .
Therefore , it is a pity that they never enjoy those thrillers in life , which are taken advantages by us young .

Nevertheless , to be fair , older people are blessed with their own merits .
On one hand , they pay more attention to details in life , which enable them to find out beauty in the somewhat mundane world .
On the other hand , they are more easily to be satisfied , thus feel more grateful to life , even if they are in adversity .

In a nutshell , despite all the advantages enjoyed by older people , I will not hesitate to side with the statement that life is more enjoyable to young .
My conclusion is based on the fact that young people are happier with new experiences .
Further more , diversity are held in higher regard in youths .
Therefore , modern society is more appealing to them .
However , we can never deny that every person enjoys his or her own happiness and blessings , which has not much to do with his or her age .
As long as we develop a genuine appreciation for life itself , life is definitely more beautiful .

"During the past ten year when the whold world has been experiencing tremendous variations in all respects , no one , more often than not , can be ignorant of such a phenomenon that whether young people or the older people are more enjoyable their life .
Apparently , different people hold diversified views due to their respective angles .
The complex nature of the above topic requires us to consider it on a case-by-case basis .
As far as I am concerned , which one has the most noteworthy advantages depends on the specific circumstances .
In the following analyses , I would like to reason and point out three conspicuous aspects favoring on my own consideration : nothing but the older people are happier with their life is necessarily put in the first place .

First of all , there is an only too indispensable reason worth a great deal to support my inclination , which is not far to seek : old people become more and more aware of the living standard .
My grandfather is a good case in point .
He is eighty-one years old but he pays more attention to his life , and arrange different activities everyday , such as playing chess , walking and so forth .
This case , undoubtedly , brings me a lot of inspirations in this respect : under this circumstance , it is obvious that older people are excited with their colorful life .

In addition , another reason that can be presented to develop my propensity centers on that older people are more satisfied with what they have .
For this point , I can not stop but cite one of my favorite German philopers , Arthur Schopenhauer , ever mentioned : satisfication is medicine of a good life .
On the contrary , the young people always complain life is not as good as they assumed .
Especially the young who just get into the society .
We can build up an accurate picture of implication behind this situation .
Unequivocally , positive conclusion can be easily inferred from it to support my idear : satisfication contributes much to a good life .

Last but absolutely not least , one more perspective that bolsters to meet my proclivity lies in the fact that the accelerate development of the society , which requires young people to world hard and can not affort enough time to enjoy their life .
For he standpoint , I prefer to take full advantage of statistical tools to analyze it , probing what we learn the numbers .
A recent survey by Sina .
com , the largest portal company of Internet , indicates that the average number of young people have to spend more than eight hours doing their work has risen by 87 % .
As is known to all , `` No one can deny the truth behind the number . ''

Admittedly , it may be right young people enjoy their life .
However , to some extent , this alone does not constitute sufficient support to claim that young people are feel more happy than older people do .

To recapitulate , taking into accounts all the dimensions of the issues discussed in the aforementioned analyses , which sometimes correlate with each other to generate a comprehensive and thus more convincing conclusion , I safely draw the attention that not only can older people be aware of the life quality , but also they are more easily satisfied what they have .
What is more , they have little sense of the fierce competition in the modern society .
On on account can we ignore the importance of the old people .

"In today's fast-paced world, the question of whether young people allocate enough time to helping their communities is a pertinent one. I believe that while there are some young individuals who may not prioritize community service as much as they should, there is a significant portion of the youth population that is actively engaged in giving back to their communities.

One reason why some young people may not give enough time to helping their communities is the increasing focus on personal and academic pursuits. With the pressure to excel in academics, extracurricular activities, and secure a promising career, many young individuals find themselves with limited time to dedicate to community service.

Furthermore, the digital age has also played a role in reducing face-to-face interactions and community engagement among young people. The allure of social media, online entertainment, and virtual interactions can sometimes overshadow the importance of real-world community involvement.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that there is a growing movement of socially conscious and active young people who are making significant contributions to their communities. Many young individuals are involved in volunteer programs, activism, and social initiatives that aim to address various social issues and create positive change.

For example, youth-led organizations like ""Students for Sustainability"" and ""Young Leaders for Social Change"" are making a tangible impact in areas such as environmental conservation, poverty alleviation, and education reform.

In conclusion, while there may be some young people who do not give enough time to helping their communities, it is unfair to generalize this behavior. Many young individuals are actively involved in community service and are passionate about making a difference. It is crucial to support and encourage these efforts to foster a culture of civic engagement and social responsibility among the youth.",P3,CHI,high,1
"The stereotypical view of today's youth as being less interested in serving their communities is contradicted by their active involvement in diverse forms of civil engagement. The truth is, young people are effecting change through unique intersections of technology, entrepreneurship, and activism, addressing both local and global community needs. They lead sustainable initiatives, developing programs that not only help the present but also lay foundations for future community stability and growth. Through networked collective action and grassroots mobilization, they are at the forefront of many campaigns and services that enrich their communities, often engaging in multi-faceted efforts that truly make a difference.",P3,CHI,high,1
"In today's fast-paced world, it is a common perception that young people do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities. However, I believe this statement is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits over community service, many others actively engage in various forms of volunteering and social activism.

One reason why some may perceive young people as not giving enough time to helping their communities is the changing nature of volunteerism. Traditional forms of community service, such as volunteering at local charities or participating in neighborhood clean-up events, may not always align with the preferences and lifestyles of today's youth. Instead, young people are increasingly leveraging technology and social media to raise awareness about social issues and mobilize support for causes they care about. Platforms like GoFundMe and Change.org have enabled young activists to make a significant impact on a global scale without necessarily committing long hours in a physical volunteer setting.

Furthermore, many young people are actively involved in advocacy work, campaigning for social justice, environmental sustainability, and other important causes. Through protests, petitions, and social media campaigns, they are raising awareness and pushing for positive change in their communities and beyond.

In conclusion, while it is true that the traditional forms of community service may have evolved among young people, their commitment to social causes and advocacy work cannot be understated. Young individuals are finding innovative ways to make a difference and give back to their communities, demonstrating that they are indeed actively engaged in helping to create a better world for all.",P3,CHI,high,1
"The stereotype of detached youth in relation to community engagement is a view I challenge, as it overlooks the multifaceted and impactful ways in which the young generation enriches their locales. The youth of today, often stigmatized as self-absorbed, are in reality deeply entwined in the fabric of community support, frequently in less traditional, yet immensely powerful forms. Their engagement is layered and extends beyond observable community service projects to encompass digital advocacy, policy change efforts, and support networks that operate through innovative channels.

In their approach to community service, modern youth adeptly combine their digital literacy with a strong sense of social justice, leading to the emergence of new vehicles for community assistance such as app development for charitable causes. Their involvement in social issues is marked by a conscientious drive to make a lasting difference, from grassroots organizing to leading charge in transitional community movements.

Moreover, young people are redefining community by including online spaces, fostering virtual assistance groups that offer support across diverse issues. The measurable impact of these enterprises is just as significant as traditional community service engagements. In recognizing that the youth's mode of engagement has adapted to the times, it becomes clear that their seemingly inconspicuous efforts are indeed interwoven within the broader tapestry of community assistance, demonstrating not a lack of engagement, but a reinvention of it.",P3,CHI,high,1
"I firmly disagree with the notion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In fact, I believe that young individuals are more involved in community service and volunteering than ever before. There are several reasons and examples to support this opinion.

Firstly, young people today are more aware of social issues and the importance of giving back to their communities. With the rise of social media and the internet, information about various global challenges and local community needs is readily available, prompting young individuals to take action and make a difference.

Secondly, many schools and universities now emphasize the importance of community service and offer opportunities for students to engage in volunteer work. This exposure at a young age instills a sense of responsibility and compassion in young people, encouraging them to actively participate in community service initiatives.

Moreover, there has been a significant increase in youth-led organizations and initiatives focused on social causes. Young people are taking the lead in addressing issues such as environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation, and mental health awareness, showcasing their dedication to making a positive impact in their communities.

For example, organizations like ""Youth Service America"" and ""DoSomething.org"" provide platforms for young people to connect with volunteer opportunities and make a difference in their communities. Additionally, youth-led movements such as the ""March for Our Lives"" and ""Fridays for Future"" demonstrate the power of young voices in driving social change and community engagement.

In conclusion, young people today are actively involved in helping their communities and are passionate about creating a better world. Through their dedication to volunteer work, advocacy efforts, and community service initiatives, young individuals are proving that they are committed to making a positive impact and shaping a more compassionate and inclusive society.",P3,CHI,high,1
"Disagreeing with the concept that youth allocate insufficient time to community help, I posit that the youth of today are more involved than ever, albeit in non-traditional capacities. In an era of information and technological advancement, young people leverage online tools to initiate and participate in community-oriented projects. Through digital platforms, they can organize, advocate, and fundraise with unprecedented efficiency and scope, demonstrating a substantial, albeit less conspicuous, commitment to community service.

Young people are at the helm of several social enterprises that innovatively blend commerce with community upliftment. These initiatives often address local issues with global relevance, such as climate action, education for all, and sustainable development. Additionally, school and university programs increasingly incorporate service learning, immersing students in real-world community issues and fostering a culture of proactive engagement.

Youth-led organizations and grassroots movements underlie a remarkable groundswell of community-focused activism, countering the narrative of apathy. The surge in youth engagement is palpable in their response to crises, as witnessed in recent natural disaster recovery efforts where their response and participation have been swift and crucial. This dedication reflects a profound awareness and a collaborative spirit, underscoring the youth's integral role in shaping resilient and supportive communities.",P3,CHI,high,1
"In today's fast-paced world, it is often argued that young people do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities. While this statement may hold some truth in certain cases, I disagree with the notion that young people as a whole are neglecting their communities. There are several reasons why I believe young individuals are actively involved in community service.

First and foremost, many young people are engaged in various forms of volunteering and community service initiatives. For instance, high school and college students frequently participate in community service projects organized by schools or local organizations. These projects range from cleaning up parks to tutoring younger students, demonstrating a commitment to giving back to their communities.

Moreover, the rise of social media has enabled young people to raise awareness about important issues and mobilize support for various causes. Through online platforms, individuals can organize fundraisers, share information about community events, and connect with like-minded individuals to make a positive impact.

Furthermore, many young professionals actively participate in corporate social responsibility programs and volunteer their time to support charitable organizations. This demonstrates that young people are not only aware of the needs of their communities but are also willing to contribute their time and resources to make a difference.

In conclusion, while some young people may prioritize personal pursuits over community service, there is a significant portion of this demographic that is actively engaged in helping their communities. Through volunteering, advocacy, and philanthropy, young individuals are making meaningful contributions to society and demonstrating their commitment to creating a positive impact.",P3,CHI,high,1
"The notion that today's youth fall short in contributing to their community's welfare is a stereotype that doesn't align with the reality of their multifaceted engagement. From organizing grassroots movements to championing causes on digital platforms, young individuals are actively redefining community service parameters. Their involvement extends to developing sustainable community programs and lending their voices to advocate for comprehensive policy reforms that address the root causes of local issues. Innovative use of technology enables them to network globally and bring international attention to local concerns, illustrating their commitment to societal betterment. In addition to their activism, many youths demonstrate community spirit through volunteerism in healthcare, education, and disaster relief, often committing to long-term projects that seek transformative change.",P3,CHI,high,1
"Contrary to the statement, my observations and experiences affirm that young people are, in fact, extensively involved in helping their communities, displaying a shift towards a more dynamic and technology-driven approach to community service. Young individuals often play instrumental roles in community betterment through extensive volunteerism, which is not limited to traditional activities but extends to modern practices that utilize digital platforms for widespread effect.

The innovative spirit of todayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs youth is evident in how they tackle community challenges, utilizing digital tools to create apps for social good, organizing online campaigns for awareness, and harnessing the power of social media to rally support for community projects. Their approach to helping may differ from past generations, with a significant portion of their efforts being less visible in the physical sense but with far-reaching impact in the digital sphere.

Moreover, youth involvement often stems from educational initiatives that emphasize the importance of community service, which schools integrate into their curricula to cultivate a sense of social responsibility. Young people actively engage in mentorship programs, participate in non-profit initiatives, and even lead movements for social and environmental justice. Their contribution might go unrecognized by traditional standards, but it is undeniably significant, and its effects are felt not only locally but globally. The versatility and adaptability of the youth in their community engagement should be acknowledged and encouraged as it is crucial for societal progress.",P3,CHI,high,1
"The idea that young people are disengaged with community service is a narrative that falls apart upon closer examination. Across numerous platforms and through various forms of direct action, today's youth are passionately involved in community improvement and social justice initiatives. They often serve as catalysts for change, spearheading environmental conservation efforts, and engaging in community education ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ all of which point to a generation not only attentive to societal needs but also actively addressing them. Young individuals are also revolutionizing charity work, using online tools to reach wider audiences and raise significant funds that fuel local and global projects.",P3,CHI,high,1
"The assertion that young people today neglect their community service duties is a broad generalization that I firmly contest. On the contrary, contemporary youth are often deeply invested in the well-being of their communities, though their methods of involvement have evolved with the advent of digital technology. The global awareness inculcated through social media has galvanized a generation keen on making meaningful contributions to society. Young activists lead and participate in efforts ranging from environmental conservation to human rights advocacy, channeling their energy into local and global causes alike.

Importantly, young individuals volunteer in education programs, lend their expertise to community development projects, and spearhead initiatives promoting social equity. College students frequently engage in internships with non-profits, gaining hands-on experience while providing invaluable service. Moreover, the current generation's entrepreneurial ventures often have a social impact focus, aiming to address issues such as homelessness, food security, and health care access within their communities.

The passion of the youth for creating sustainable change is also manifested in their choice to support ethical consumerism and corporate social responsibility. They are not just volunteering time; they are also making conscious decisions that reflect their commitment to societal change. Thus, the narrative that young people are disengaged is contradicted by the ground realities of their vibrant, albeit unconventional, community participation.",P3,CHI,high,1
"While some believe young people are disengaged from community service, my stance is quite the opposite. Young individuals are redefining what it means to serve through innovative approaches that transcend traditional participation. Volunteering and activism have been transformed by technology, with social networks enabling widespread organization and awareness-raising for causes. Youth are instrumental in tech-based solutions for local issues, developing apps and platforms to streamline charitable work and social services. Hands-on community service remains a strong focus, with many educational systems incorporating community engagement directly into their curricula. Moreover, the increasing involvement of youth in policymaking and governance, including participation in local councils and initiatives, challenges the notion that they are disinterested in community welfare. Their activism, particularly in areas such as climate change, social justice, and global health, underscores a commitment to not just local but also global communities. The narrative that young people do not dedicate time to their communities fails to capture the dynamic and consequential forms of engagement that are characteristic of this generation.",P3,CHI,high,1
"In today's fast-paced world, the debate over whether young people allocate enough time to helping their communities is a pertinent one. I believe that while some young individuals are actively engaged in community service, there is a significant portion that may not be giving as much time as they could. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon.

Firstly, the rise of technology and social media has consumed a large portion of young people's time. Many individuals spend hours on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat, leading to a decrease in the time available for community service. This constant digital connectivity can create a sense of detachment from real-world issues and diminish the motivation to get involved in community initiatives.

Moreover, the competitive nature of today's society, with its emphasis on academic and career success, often leaves young people feeling overwhelmed and pressured to prioritize personal goals over community involvement. The pursuit of academic excellence, extracurricular activities, internships, and part-time jobs can leave little room for volunteering or engaging in community service projects.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that there are still many young individuals who actively contribute to their communities through volunteering, organizing fundraisers, or participating in environmental clean-up efforts. These young changemakers serve as inspiring examples of the positive impact that dedicated youth can have on society.

In conclusion, while it is evident that some young people may not be giving enough time to helping their communities, it is essential to recognize and celebrate those who are actively engaged in making a difference. Encouraging a culture of social responsibility and providing opportunities for youth to get involved can help bridge the gap and inspire more young individuals to prioritize community service.",P3,CHI,high,1
"It is a common misconception that the inclination of the younger generation towards community service has waned. In fact, they are actively reimagining the scope of such activities. They engage with their communities through a multitude of platforms and strategies, often not immediately visible to older generations. Technology has enabled them to launch online campaigns and movements for causes ranging from local to international concerns. Meanwhile, their on-the-ground efforts continue through organizing neighborhood enhancement projects, serving in homeless shelters, and working with local advocacy groups. Moreover, numerous students participate in service-learning programs that allow them to integrate academic study with meaningful community service, thus broadening their understanding of societal impact. Even in seemingly leisure pursuits, such as digital content creation, young individuals find ways to galvanize support for community causes, proving that their methods, while novel, are equally committed to fostering communal well-being.",P3,CHI,high,1
"In today's fast-paced world, it is often argued that young people do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities. However, I disagree with this statement for several reasons.

Firstly, many young people are actively involved in various community service initiatives, volunteering programs, and social causes. They participate in activities such as cleaning up local parks, organizing charity events, tutoring underprivileged children, and raising awareness about important issues. These efforts demonstrate that young people do care about their communities and are willing to contribute their time and energy to make a positive impact.

Furthermore, technology has made it easier for young people to engage in community service. Online platforms and social media channels provide opportunities for them to connect with organizations and find volunteering opportunities that align with their interests and skills. This enables young people to contribute to their communities in a way that is convenient and accessible to them.

Moreover, it is essential to consider the various challenges that young people face, such as academic pressures, extracurricular commitments, and personal responsibilities. Despite these obstacles, many young individuals still manage to find time to give back to their communities, showcasing their dedication and compassion.

In conclusion, while there may be instances where young people are not as involved in community service as desired, it is unfair to generalize and claim that they do not give enough time to helping their communities. The examples and reasons provided above illustrate that many young people are actively engaged in making a difference and should be commended for their efforts.",P3,CHI,high,1
"It is a misconception that young people today are not giving enough time to helping their communities. In reality, the youth of this era are deeply committed to social and community improvement, albeit in ways that differ from previous generations. The advent of digital and social media has provided young activists with powerful tools to communicate, gather support, and mobilize for various causes. These range from environmental sustainability drives to social justice campaigns that often have far-reaching impacts. Moreover, many young people are engaging in creative forms of community service, such as social entrepreneurship that aims to solve community issues through sustainable business models. The global youth response to recent humanitarian crises further exemplifies their readiness to serve and the effectiveness of their collective action. The traditional metrics for community involvement may not fully capture the extent of young people's contributions, which often occur in less visible but equally significant forums.",P3,CHI,high,1
"The perception that young individuals are not fully contributing to community assistance is increasingly challenged by the evidence of their widespread involvement. Young activists are not only engaging in community service in the traditional sense but are also utilizing their online presence for advocacy and change, garnering attention for issues that would otherwise go unnoticed. They have been instrumental in creating apps and online tools that facilitate greater community organization and aid distribution. Educational institutes are also playing a pivotal role by embedding community service into their programs, encouraging students to take part in local and sometimes even global community development projects. Furthermore, the youth's contribution to the community is evident in their role during times of crisis, where they are often some of the first responders, providing innovative solutions to pressing problems and showing an impressive ability to organize and enact rapid relief efforts.",P3,CHI,high,1
"It is a narrow view to suggest that young people are not allocating enough time to help their communities. In truth, the world is witnessing a surge of youth-led initiatives that have a profound impact on various facets of community life. Armed with digital tools, young individuals are founding community-focused start-ups, running educational workshops, and engaging in policy advocacy to bring about tangible improvements in their localities. Their zeal for community service is visible in national and international arenas, where their campaigns and initiatives frequently lead to substantive policy changes and societal advancements. Moreover, the youth of today are applying their knowledge and passions in creative ways, such as through art and music, to raise awareness about community issues and foster a sense of unity and purpose within their social environments.",P3,CHI,high,1
"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are several reasons for this trend.

Firstly, the fast-paced nature of modern life, with its focus on academics, careers, and personal pursuits, leaves young people with limited time to dedicate to community service. The pressure to excel in education and secure a stable job often takes precedence over volunteering or community involvement.

Secondly, the rise of technology and social media has led to a more individualistic society where young people are often more focused on their online presence and personal interests rather than on contributing to their communities. The virtual world can create a sense of disconnect from the real world and reduce the motivation to engage in community service.

Moreover, the lack of awareness and exposure to community issues among young people can also contribute to their limited involvement in helping their communities. Without a deep understanding of the challenges faced by their communities, young people may not feel compelled to take action and make a difference.

In conclusion, while there are various factors influencing the level of community engagement among young people today, it is evident that there is a need for greater emphasis on promoting volunteerism and civic responsibility. Encouraging young people to allocate time for community service can foster a sense of social responsibility and create a more compassionate and engaged society.",P3,CHI,high,1
"The allegation that young people shirk community responsibility fails to account for their profound and diverse engagement. Across the globe, youth are increasingly at the forefront of social entrepreneurship, transforming their innovative ideas into concrete solutions for community development. Their contributions, often harnessed through digital platforms, include sophisticated fundraising campaigns and awareness movements. Moreover, they are shattering the mold of traditional community service, replacing it with a blend of activism, advocacy, and direct service that is both globally informed and locally executed. Their efforts in local initiatives such as urban gardens, educational workshops, and peer mentoring programs signify a deeper understanding of and commitment to communal needs.",P3,CHI,high,1

Their methods and approaches to community engagement have evolved, embracing a global perspective while addressing local challenges. Youth-driven initiatives, from digital advocacy to community mentorship programs, indicate a nuanced understanding of the various ways one can effect change. Community-building today does not always resemble the efforts of past generations, but it achieves similar, if not greater, impacts through innovation and collaboration. Young voices are catalyzing change in community support systems, fashioning a proactive and progressive approach to societal involvement.",P3,CHI,high,1
"Assertions that young people are not dedicating time to community assistance overlook their substantial investment in shaping a better future. Today's youth harness modern technologies to communicate, collaborate, and create impactful social change, often in ways that elude traditional forms of recognition. They lead organic movements to address inequalities, support diversity, and protect the environment within their communities. By blending digital advocacy with tangible action, like cleaning public spaces and supporting local businesses, they are vital to the community fabric, often setting an example of what conscientious citizenship entails.",P3,CHI,high,1
"The statement that the youth today do not allocate adequate time to community service does not hold true in my opinion. The landscape of community engagement has transformed with the integration of technology and the evolving nature of social issues, and this is where the youth are leveraging their strengths. Young people are often at the heart of community development, whether through direct service or through advocacy work that tackles systemic issues affecting local communities.

Many young individuals are choosing to express their civic commitment through non-traditional forms of assistance, such as digital activism, impact-focused social entrepreneurship, and even using art and culture as tools for social engagement. They build networks, organize awareness campaigns, and raise funds through platforms that transcend geographical boundaries, suggesting that their impact is as robust as it is widescale.

Local community projects, especially those aimed at sustainability and inclusivity, are frequently driven by the energy and fresh perspectives of the youth. For example, urban gardening projects or peer-led after-school programs illustrate their direct involvement in improving community well-being. Moreover, youth are increasingly represented in local councils and boards, influencing decisions and policies that affect community life.

Furthermore, many young people are deeply involved in nonprofit entities and NGOs, contributing countless hours to volunteering efforts. They lead by example, organizing events such as local food drives or international education programs. Several young individuals also partake in social entrepreneurship, merging business acumen with community service to address pressing local issues. The variety and depth of their engagement reflects a robust commitment to societal betterment that arguably surpasses traditional participation methods.",P3,CHI,high,1
"Young people today are perceived by some as disengaged from community activities, but I contend that this is a misinterpretation of their actual involvement. The new generation contributes through innovative channels that often go unnoticed by traditional standards. Rather than diminishing, their service has adapted to the modern landscape, leveraging technology to effect change. For instance, initiatives like virtual tutoring and global fundraising demonstrate their ability to impact communities both at home and abroad. Additionally, youth-led organizations have spotlighted issues such as mental health, driving positive change. With their unique blend of passion and pragmatism, young volunteers frequently offer fresh perspectives in solving local challenges, from initiating environmental projects to bolstering community support for marginalized groups. Their activism is not limited to physical presence but extends into the realms of policy and digital advocacy, effectuating substantial improvements in community welfare.",P3,CHI,high,1
"In today's fast-paced world, the debate over whether young people are dedicating enough time to helping their communities is a contentious issue. I firmly believe that young people nowadays are actively engaged in community service and are making significant contributions to society.

With the help of social media and the internet, they have easy access to information about various problems affecting their communities. This awareness often translates into action, as many young individuals are passionate about creating positive change and are actively involved in volunteering for causes they care about.

Furthermore, the younger generation is highly motivated to make a difference. They participate in community service projects, organize fundraisers, and initiate awareness campaigns to address pressing issues such as poverty, environmental sustainability, and mental health. For instance, youth-led movements like Fridays for Future, which advocate for climate action, have gained significant traction worldwide, showcasing the dedication of young people to community service.

In conclusion, while some may argue that young people do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities, I believe that the evidence suggests otherwise.

They are laying new groundwork and challenging previous community service concepts through both direct action and digital engagement. Youths are not just volunteering; they are infusing their community efforts with creativity and strategic thinking. Many have become deeply involved in advocacy, using digital tools to lend their voice to those in need and to mobilize resources.

Online movements often translate into real-world impact, including fundraising for local tragedies and organizing neighborhood improvement projects.

Youth today are raised in an era of heightened global awareness and are educated in the importance of sustainability and social responsibility. Schools often have service-learning programs that combine classroom curriculum with meeting community needs. Young people participate in wide-ranging efforts from environmental cleanups to tutoring at-risk peers. Increased access to information has also made today's youth aware of the broader societal issues that impact their immediate communities, driving them to volunteer and engage with local non-profits to enact positive change.

Furthermore, the rise in youth entrepreneurship often has a community-focused angle, with many young startups aiming to solve local problems such as food deserts or education gaps.

"In today's fast-paced world, there is an ongoing debate on whether young people are dedicating enough time to helping their communities. I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to community service for several reasons.

Firstly, the rise of technology and social media has consumed a significant portion of young people's time. With the allure of social media platforms and video games, many young individuals find themselves engrossed in virtual worlds rather than engaging in real-world community service activities.

Secondly, the education system and career pressures often leave little time for young people to actively participate in community service. The intense focus on academic achievements and the competitive job market leave students and young professionals with limited time to volunteer or engage in community development projects.

Moreover, the lack of awareness and encouragement from parents and schools regarding the importance of community service plays a role in the diminishing involvement of young people. Without proper guidance and motivation, many young individuals may not realize the value of giving back to their communities.

For example, a study conducted by a leading research institute found that only a small percentage of young adults actively participate in community service initiatives compared to previous generations.

In conclusion, while there are various factors contributing to the limited involvement of young people in community service, it is essential to raise awareness, provide incentives, and create opportunities for them to contribute meaningfully to their communities. Encouraging a culture of giving back from a young age can help instill a sense of social responsibility and empathy in the younger generation.",P3,CHI,high,1

While this may be true to some extent, I disagree with the blanket statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to community service.

Firstly, many young people are actively involved in various community service projects and initiatives. They volunteer at local charities, participate in environmental clean-up efforts, and engage in mentoring programs for underprivileged youth. For example, numerous high school and college students organize fundraisers, food drives, and awareness campaigns to address social issues such as homelessness and poverty. These young individuals show a strong commitment to making a positive impact in their communities.

Secondly, advancements in technology have enabled young people to support their communities in innovative ways. Social media platforms and online fundraising websites have made it easier for young individuals to raise awareness and funds for important causes. For instance, young activists use social media to mobilize support for environmental conservation projects and humanitarian aid efforts around the world. This digital activism demonstrates the power of young people to effect change through virtual platforms.

Lastly, it is essential to recognize that young people today face unique challenges and responsibilities that may limit their ability to dedicate extensive time to community service. Many young individuals juggle academic commitments, part-time jobs, and personal responsibilities, leaving them with limited free time. Despite these challenges, young people still find ways to contribute to their communities, even if it means volunteering for a few hours a week or participating in one-off service projects.

Many young people has already forgotten about their communities , forgotten that that are other people besides themselves , forgotte that the community needs their help and is more than happy to receive a helping hand from them .

Many young people nowadays are more self absorbed than back then .
They have learned to be more self driven to their own goal regardless of the sacrifices and so on .
They learned about individuality and competition .
They do not realize the importance of helping their communities .
Although there are many public awareness campaign on this issue but it is not enough to drive the young people to help their communties .

Most of the young people are more concerned with social status than anything else these days .
They are preoccupied with being popular than to see what the communities need .
They see community service as a task or chore or a boring thing to do rather than a healthy and honorable action .
They do not picture this as a cool thing to do and it is probably not on their prioirity list .
They do not see the bigger picture of the society and that others may need a helping hand .

Most young people spend most of their time on the computer .
They are surfing the internet for information , they are using the computer to communicate with others , to play games as well as to obtain other source of entertainment .
Other source of entertainment such as shopping malls , coffee joints , clubs and bars have more appeal to the young people nowadays rather than helping the community .
Due to the time spent on electroninc gadgets such as computers , and entertaining themselves with other activities such as going out with friends to malls and so on , young people have limited free time to help put their communities .

However , nowadays , It is argued that young people do not contribute to their community than in old days I agree with this opinion , since I believe the young people do not have enough time , do not have enough chances to communicate with others in the community , and also lack of the good motivation to help their comunity .

First , the young people now experience more presssure in their job and study than before , they have to work very hard to compete their peers , which make them really lack of time to have other activities insteading of working or studying .
They spend all the time in the classrooms or office .
And even when they go home at night , they will be so tired that can only go sleep at home instead of going outside to help their communities .

The other reason is that , nowadays the communities in human society seem have less chance for the people , especially for the young people , to communicate with each other .
For some stupid reaons , such as security , all the buildings in the cities are built like prisons .
All the doors are locked so firmly that even the mice could n't get in .
The people living in these `` prisons '' are usally not familiar with their neighbors even their are living in the next doors .
This makes the young people do not consider their community as their own , and thus might not show up publicly so ofte .
That 's why they do n't even have the chnace to help their community .

Finally , the people of all society , including the young people of course , become less and less motivated to help their communities .
As the economic development of our society , the people more and more focus on money as the value of the life , while disregard the good reputation they might earn from the society .
Usualy the young people will obtain nothing except some apreciation form their community if they do contribute to it .
This make them feel valueless to help the community , and thus spend less and less time to take part in the community activities .

To summerize , the young people indeed contribute less time to help their comunities , and I think it 's the problem of our cultrure nowadays , which actually encourage the people disregard their communities , and do not allow the people have enough time to paticipate the activites of their communities .
I think it would be better for our future , if the young people can do more for their coummnities .

"I strongly agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites .
Being a volunteer myself at the National University Hospital for more than three years , I have sensed that the communities does need a lot of help from the general public .
However , the young people involved in this project are extremely few .
There are numerous reasons for this phenomenon .

The first reason would be a lack of interest .
We face a great difficulty to recruit people every year .
They are simply attracted to other booths that are considered more interesting , such as Outdoor Activities Club , Dance Society and Rock Climbing Club .
These activities involve a lot of physical movement and help them to bond better with their friends .
They have a golden chance to know more about people from their age and build firmer friendship via such activities .
Helping the communities , on the other hand , usually requires the interaction with people outside the school .
Most of the time , they are from another age group .
It is very difficult to get the young people interested or excited to talk with the elderly patients for two hours straight or to play with kids who hardly know any ` hot ' music or movies .
Young people believe that they could hardly gain anything out of helping the communities .
As a result , most of them are not interested .
This also explains why Ministry of Education in Singapore sets compulsory hours of community service for the Junior College students .
If not , young people would not set time aside for such activities .

Secondly , time contraint usually hinders the young people to helping their communities .
Young people nowadays are preoccupied with simply too many activities , such as school work , co-curriculum activities and other entertainment programs .
In Singapore universities , we have to attend lectures , laboratories , tutorials and seminars for almost 30 hours a week .
During our spare time , we have numerous project meetings , assignments , essays and tests to prepare and study for .
In our mere free time , we tend to relax by chatting on MSN , surfing the Internet , playing computer games , watching movies or joining club activities such as bridge club , skating club , outdoor activities club etc .
This simply leaves us little time to help the communities .

Thirdly , young people , especially people from rich families , are not mature enough to face the reality in the communities .
Grown up in a wealthy family who live in condominiums or private houses , young people do not see the other side of the society .
They do not recognize the existence of people who work 14 hours a day and earn a meager income , who live on public pensions of 200 dollars a month ( equivalent for the cost of their newly bought Nike shoes ) , who live in a house without electricity and gas supply , who are sick but have no money to see a doctor and who are too weak to see the sun-rise on the next morning .
Helping their communities provides too cruel a reality for them to accept .
As a result , they opt to escape from facing them completely .

In conclusion , it is my stand that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This may be due to their lack of interest , time constraints or their intention to escape from the cruel reality .

"I agree with the statement that young people today do not give enough time to helping their comminities .
This can be attributed to some of the social as well as educational problems that we are having today .

Firstly , the accumulation of wealth in our society has made the life of the young today much easier than their father generations .
The young usually lead comfortable life that they do not have to worry about anything .
This type of life has caused them to have a lack of experience of problems that people can meet in life and have little understanding of other people 's needs .
As a result , they may not have the initiative to take part in any community works .
For example , a typical family in Singapore enjoys the living standard of a developed country and the young people in the country mostly cares about the popular stars in the media or in the sports only .
They lack the caring attitudes for other people and they do not care about the community works either .

Secondly , the education that young people received today mainly focuses on academics and extra curriculum acitivities , which usually have high criteria for them to achieve .
As a result the young will be likely to concentrate themselves on their respective school works only that they do not spare their time for community works .
In the case of Singapore , the students receive very high expectations from both their teachers and parents .
Many of them have to strive hard to achieve certain goals .
In addition to that , the extra curriculum activities may occupy majority of their spare time including the time after school and the weekends so much that they may only be able to leave school after nine o'clock in the night each day .
In circumstances like above , the students will not have the time to go for community works even if they wish to .

The Third reason to the little participation of young today in community work today may be attributed to the kind of education that they receive at home .
In the case of Singapore , the parents do not encourage the children to go out and get involved in community works because these are regarded as `` Adults ' work '' .
The young grown up in this kind of family background will have a natural notion to stay away from the community works .
This may only apply to the case of Singaproe , but for the cases of many other countries , some parents may try to influence the children not to getting involved in teh community works because these works do not bring them benefits !
The family education of this type may install a sense of selfishness in the young and restrain them from community work .

In conclusion , the young people are not giving enough time to help their communities , but it is not a problems that oriented from the young alone .

"I agree with this statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . ''
Since the society we live in has changed with time , people nowadays spend more time establishing their own affairs and therefore they are easily tended to ignore the needs of other people , and young people are no exception .
In fact , young people spend most of their time concerning about their studies , their future careers , and they might be too busy to give time to help their communities .

Take Taiwan , my homecountry , as an example .
It is surely a very small island in the world , but meanwhile , there are still many people on this island .
The population density is astonishing .
Therefore , people here need to work or study hard in order to compete with others , and that might take them much time .
Young people in Taiwan need to worry about the school exams they are taking everyday and the future careers they are going to pursue .
They spend so much time at home studying or going to the cram schools that they only have little time for themselves , not to mention for their communities .

What 's more , people nowadays live more in apartments than in houses .
That is why they have fewer chances to communicate and interact with other people .
People living in apartments or mansions may not see the necessity of giving time to helping their communities or they may even think that there is no need for them to do so .
Indeed , it is nice to help the community , but not giving time to the community does not have any difference .

According to the reasons and examples I menioned above , I do agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites .
And that will remain as a current trend in the present time and also in the future .

"Young people stand for the future of one society .
It is worthy of discussing what they do when they are free .
Recently there are many reports of younth consumption of luxury purse and cosmetics in Taiwan .
Young people are depicted as egocentric and indifferent to social conditions in such reports .
Is it true that the youth nowadays are no longer embodiment of passion to change the world ?

Examining carefully , there are many examples of enthusiastic young men to help their community .
For instance , a group of sophomore and junior students in Yang Ming Medical College annually visit Yu Li Asylum to support therapists there .
The prepartion begun at least one year earlier .
These future doctors learn not only from textbooks but also from interacting with patients .
They are not satistfied with a knowleage of disease and therapies ; human beings are their ultimate concerns .

Since some young people contribute their leisure to those who are in need , then where does the myth of aloof youth come from in Taiwan ?
I think there might be some reasons behind the prejudice to young people .
Nowadays young people are more daring to express their discontent to social realities than their parents did .
But our society regards these opinions as pure complaint , a symbol of arrogance .
This is the first mistake ,

Although some young people are busy indulging in various kinds of luxures , others are dedicated to improvement of where they live .
It is not fair to deny the effort made by young people tip a tag of laziness .
So I ca n't agree that young people nowadays do n't give enough time for their community .

"I totally agree with the statement that the young people today really do n't spend enough time helping their communities .
And that is also what I do n't want to see and expect .
In the following disscusion , I will present the reasons which cause the result and how to solve the problem .

The first reason why the young people today do n't give time to help their communities is that there are more and more things attract them .
When the young students are after class , they may do some activities with their friends such as shoping or something like that .
The beautiful clothes in the department stores or the popular video games in the club may attract them .
That means that they will pay more attention on what they like and spend more time on what they are intereted in .
So that is why the young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
There are lots of things they want .
It makes sence that they may forget some other important things such as the communities stuff .

The second reason is that the most young people tend to take the material they have for granted .
They do not appreciate it because they think that they deserve it .
So maybe they will think that the communities stuff is not their business and they do n't have to take the responsibility for it .

Toward this problem , I think the best solution is education .
We have to teach the young people about their duty of helping their communities .
A good community is based on many people 's effort .
We have to let them know that they are also the part of the communities .
So they should spend enough time toward it no matter what reasons they have .
To be more specific , let me give an example to explain more clearly .
Each of us all belongs to a family .
So who should spend time on the household things .
I think that you will say each member in the family should spend time on them .
And that is what I want to say .
Just like this example , each member in the community should give enough time to help their communities because they are the members in the communities .

T sum up , I agree that in today 's society , young people really spend less time to help the communities .
And the reasons why is just like what I mention above .
What we can do is try our best to teach them about the importance of the participation in the communities .

"It is claimed that teenagers nowadays have less time to commit themselves to activities other than academic pursuits ; they do not give enough time to helping their communities .
However , I disagrees with the claim , as in the perspective of a young student , I still see a lot of young people squeeze out time to help their communities .

In my school , there are a lot of organized programmes for students to engage in to help their communities .
We are offered precious opportunities to visit old folk homes and valuable chances to ask for donations for disabled children .
I was also proud that I participated in activities for charity organisations to perform harmonica in public to gather donations from people .
There are a lot of students who are also actively involved in community programmes to fulfill themselves and to contribute to society and their communities through whatever ways they can .

Last year , local universities stop to use Community Involvement Programme ( CIP ) as a criterion for admission of freshman applicant .
The main reason is that the Ministry Of Education ( MOE ) wishes to discourage students from participating in community programmes for the sake of earning CIP hours , which was used as a criterion for university admission .
However , after MOE has discarded the old system , there are still a lot of students who engage actively in community work , which is a testimony to the fact that most students are helping their communities to contribute to society not , for the sake of getting into a university .

In addition , given the ample opportunities for yound people to help their communities , many have take advantage of the organized school activities to experience the real life of poor people .
Nowadays , people are generally more affluent than before , but there are still a lot of unfortunate people who cannot escape from the vicious cycle of poverty .
Thus , some students from wealthy families take advantage of their opportunity to go overseas to help poor people .
In my school , there are organized programmes for students to travel to Thailand and other poor areas to help to teach the poor students who are deprived of the opportunity to learn in a comfotable classroom as we do .
Every year , there are a lot of students who apply for the programme , to the extent that our school has to select students for the overseas trips .
Many students are compelled to help the poor people .
Those who are given the opportunity to travel abroad also ask for the whole school population to donate books and unused stationaries to the poverty stricken students .

Therefore , in conclusion , despite the hectic schedules of comteporary young people , I still think that many youth sincerely wants to contribute to their communities and help to make the world a better place for all homo sapiens to live in , regardless of race , language or religion .

"Living in a modern and high-paced society , with the gaining severity of competitions and the emphasis on personal achievements , people seem to have less concern on others .
With the changing of the living style , a community seems to have lost its previous function of holding every member together for people are more involved in personal activities .
And all these changes affect on the younger generation .
However , there seem to be a initiation of change in this minimizing time devotion to the community by young people .

The lost of devotion in the community has long been concerned by observers and scholars , thus , certain modifications are made in the educational system , such as that in the National Taiwan University which I am currently attending .
A special program is designed , aiming for students to provide services to the community .
This program is conducted by the advisors , and every univesity students would have to complete at least three semesters of services in order to graduate .
This serves as a response to the insufficent concern given by the young generation and is expecting the students to be inspired by this experience .

In the last semester , our advisor design a special service activity for our class .
By cooperating with a well-known organization which provides help to the homeless , the elderly , and the people who are suffering from brain damage , my classmates and I were able to provide services to these minorities of the society .
After a official training course , we helped the patients to bath , talked with the elder people who lived alone , and helped the organization to hold activities during special occasions like the mother 's day .
In participation , we were able to discover that not only us , but many younger students from junior high schools were seen helping in the organization , along with lots of volunteers .
I personally bathed a patient under the professional assistance of the students from nursery school .
Seeing all these young people , as old as or even younger than my age , devoting their time helping others deeply moved me .

We were asked to write reports according to the services , and the responds where enthusiatic .
One of the reports even appeared on the school news paper .
Further cooperation is established , and is expected to rouse more response among these once `` unconcerned '' young people .

Under the tutoring and properly designed program , the young people , who are once closing in the small academic world , are able to reach out their arms and to embrace the others - within the community , and hopefully to the whole human beings .

"Nowadays , people are getting busier and busier with their own bussiness , especially the young people who are fighting hard for their future .
As a result , there comes the criticism that the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
In my opinion , this statement is groundless and the youngsters today do contribute to their communities to a great extent .

To begin with , we will first look at the community service organised by various schools .
Taking Singapore as an example , it is compulsory for each student to accomplish a minumum time of 10 to 30 hours of community service each year , depending on different schools and different level of education .
The service includes helping out in old folks ' home , organizing charity events and so on .
It has greated contributed to the communities considering the size of student population .
And not only Singapore , schools in other countries have similiar policies as well to make the students contributed within their ability .

Secondly , many working young people today are voltunteers in various organizaitions such as hospitals and kindergartens .
Besiding donating their money , they also spend a lot of time in taking care of the patients or children and gain a deeper understanding of their needs .
In fact , from my experience of being a volunteer , some institutions actually depend on these young people as an effective human resources .
And each volunteer spends about 3 to 5 hours per week in these voluntary jobs .

Lastly , there are many other minor areas that the young peole make contributions on .
For instance , to help the neighbouring children with their school work is a form of contribution .
And everyone may have attended some performces for charity purposes , and that is helping his community too .

Therefore , I believe that it is unfair to say that the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The helps in various forms can be easily seen in every aspect of our life .
Actually , I think the young people have done a great job in helping out their communities .
",P3,CHI,high,0
"Basically I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping or involving in their comminities .
Young people now live in a modern life that provides them with a lot more choices than they could have had in the past .
Internet is the typical example .
Young people spend a great deal of time surfing on net , whether doing research of school work , chatting with friends or playing online computer game .

There are also other attractions besides internet , such as travelling .
The improvement of transporation allow people to travel to other countries at faster speed and cheaper cost .
It was not common to hear or to see students plan to spend their summer vacation in another country or across the Pacific ocean back in the 60s or 70s .

Moreover , the development of modern society is also the main cause .
Population increase is associated with the growth of modern cities .
More people live in the cities , more children grow up in the cities .
A young man 's childhood in the city could be very different from the one spent his own in the country side .
Due to the different lifestyle , kids grow up in the citiy are generally more distant to strangers and people they are not familiar with .
They are possibly told by the parents and teachers to be aware of strangers when they are young as the crime rate is normally considered higher in the city , such as kidnapping .
Growing under this circumstances will naturally make them more self-centered and distant .

Another reason is probably because the relationship young people have with their comminity is rather shallow .
Most people , including adults and young people , rarely have any interaction with their neighbors .
As a result , they would not devote themselves to community activity ; they 'd rather to spend time focusing on their personal lives .
",P3,CHI,high,0
"I agree that young people nowadays do not offer enough time to helping their communities .
Considering too many entertainments in their environment and too many academic assignments in their school , and too less timie to rest , young people certainly spend insufficient time on their community-related tasks .

First , it is too many attractive entertainments in our modern society that make young people indulge themselves in these entertainments .
For example , in my dewelling city , there are full of all kinds of entertainments , such as pub , movie theaters , and department stores .
The young people spend their each weekend and holidays on shopping , seeing the movies , and playing .
As a result , they have less willingness to devote to their communities .

Second , it is a great number of school assignments that prevent young people from attending community affairs .
Today , young students have more homework , assignments , and quizzes to complete than before .
Because of the more accessibility of of knowledge and information , young people are required to do more practice and take more examinations during their education , which reduce their possibility to join communities .

Finally , it is lack of enough resting time that young people might not have extra energy to engage in the community affairs .
For example , in my country , young students have to attend cram school after formal school classes .
Also , they are expected to take various art or music classes only because their parents ask them to do so .
In this case , they could n't have enough time to rest , not to mention that they plan to help their communities .

In summary , I agree that today , young people give much less time to helping their communities for several reasons , which may be mentioned above , too many time on entertainments and school assignments and less time to rest .

"Do young people just worry about their life and academic courses , and not worry about the society ?
Are young people so selfish that they cannot contribute just a little bit of their time to the society they live in ?
How about all the homeless people who have nowhere to go ?
What about the old beggars who do not have money to support their family ?
Even as young people , we do help our communities by creating clubs such as UNICEF , and cleaning up places for a better environment .

In my school just a year ago , a teacher , Ms. Levine , started an organization called UNICEF .
It is an organization where we help the children that need help .
Mostly , the children who need help are the ones who have no place to stay , no money to support medication , or no proper education .
When this club was introduced , a lot of young people joined , not because they could get community service credits , but because they could actually help by devoting their time to it .
Just by dedicating time to provide service , we could raise money to save a child from neumonia or starvation , and that 's what 's most important .

The environment , a place where we 're all affected , is gradually polluting the place .
Every year , the school decides to take students to the beach to clear up glass pieces , plastic bags that are polluting the environment .
The students who joins this event every year did not join because they could ditch one day of class , because the event is on a saturday .
The young students are willing to give up their weekend to stay under the boiling sun and clean up in the beach and make the world a better place .

Time is unlimited .
Young people have time for themselves , but they would also find time to help the community .
If not , they would n't be willing to go to the beach on a saturday morning to clean up , nor would they join UNICEF to help children who have no affiliation with them .
Most young people would actually enjoy helping the community rather than take it as a threat .

"Personally , I am disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
In my opinion , I have three reasons to support my saying , they are the increasing community service certification , the sense of youth social responsibility , and the expend concept of international community .

Firstly , the increasing community service certification among campus .
For example , there are more and more universities provide community service certification to encourage students to contribute more time to helping their communities .
Under the improvement of community service certification , more young people are eager to give more time to do so .

In addition , the sense of youth social responsibility is addressed among society recently .
For instance , a lot of NGOs hold seminasr and conferences to bring youth people together to discuss the issue of youth social responsibility .
Meanwhile , more young people express their opinion on internet platform and implement action among their communities .
Furthermore , the development of techonology bring chances and channels for youth people to contribute their thoughts and effors for community service .
For example , I have joined an online conference which was about youth community action , mainly connected between Taipei and Kaohsiung .
To decrese the cost of transportation and physical attendance time , I still had the opportunity to express my opinion and had the smooth interaction with other participants .

Finally , The expend concept of international community arises .
According to the idea of globalization , there is no limitation among countries , especially there is no barriers between commmunities .
For instance , I can easily reach another community to have cooperation for improving my community 's weakness .
Moreover , the use of technology for communication , young people develop their potential to make positive impact to helping their communities internationally .
For example , I had a discussion forum on my blog of September , 21st earthquake recovery several years ago .
There were quite vast young people replied and gave me advices to make some improvements for my community .

To summarize , the increasing community service certification among university fields , the addressed sense of youth social responsibility , and the international community concept are main support evidence to prove that young people nowadays do make efforts and give a lot of time to helping their communities .

"As a high school student , I am often pretty upset and even a little irritated of the generally misconception of the young generation has become more selfish if compared with the previous generation .
That is , frenquently heard from adults that young people have no contribution to others and even the communities they belong to .

That is completely wrong !
Take my school for instance , we do care about our communities and in fact spend plenty of time to do all kinds of voluntary works in out communities .
Almost every weekend , students from different grades gather together in front of our school at seven in the morning .
You may be quite curious what we are going to do ?
It 's saturday !
Students then be divided into several groups by teachers and after that , it 's time for us start our mission .
Actually , we are assigned different jobs to do every weekend ; sometimes we clean the streets which we do most frequently ; sometimes we visit some charities in the community to do voluntary jobs for them ; sometimes we clean the park , located next to our school ; sometimes we hold band performances as entertainment for people in the community who have no idea what to do on the weekends .
Sounds interesting and tempting ?
Absolutely .

Stuents at my school are encouraged to join these activities because our teschers stress that school is n't the only place for learning .
To tell the truth , this is excatly what I think and the most important reason encouraging me to give up my holidays .
I still remember clearly once we were to visit kids with similar ages with us but suffer from mental illness or other disabilities .
I was quite afraid because I thought they might be scary in both appearances and behaviors .
But what I had seen was their most sincere smiles and enthusiaism to make friends with each us .
From then , I started to visit them frenquently with some books and clothes as gifts for them .
I come to realize there is never a border between people , once I 've decide to open my mind to accept and respect .

These activities held by schools to encourage students to get involved in their communitues are n't unheard form other shcools and other parts of my country .
Young people are n't careless about involving and helping others in thier communities but rather entusiaistic and willing to help , once we know how to step out our first step .

"I could not say that every young person dedicate themselves to helping their communities , but I do think that a large number of them are doing a large amount of voluntary work to help make a better community .

I have witnessed many participations in social service by young people around me .
When I was in high school in Hong Kong , the city where I live , almost everybody at school joined at least one volutary activity , be it elderly home visit or fund-raising carnival .
Some put a lot of effort into organizing these voluntary work , while others supported by generous donation or active participations .
We all enjoyed being involved in these activities , knowing that we are contributing to our communities .

I have personally contributed and experienced community work , too .
As members of the Hong Kong Red Cross Youth Units , my team mates and I have initiated a few service projects which served the objectives of charity organizations .
We designed a 3-day programme , which included a fun day for elderly and children , to convey messages such as social harmony and cross-generation communication .
All of us have dedicated ourselves into the preparation and launching of the projects .
It was time-consuming but we all believed that it was worth making a more joyful community .

Helping the communities is not only demonstrated by actual participation in voluntary work .
I think that the young people who are really making contribution are those who manage their time well between voluntary work and academic study .
We should always look at things in the long term .
Instead of complaining that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , maybe we should appreciate how they are trying to get the most of their study and contribute to the society later on .
That means that they are not wasting the resources that the society is giving them in their education .
They also prove that the ` investment ' in their education will generate returns when contribute what they learn back to the society .
Are n't they helping their communities , too ?

Many young people are actually aware of their positions in their communities and are giving a lot of time to help .
We should appreciate what they have done and encourage those who are doing less to contribute more .
Ultimately they will be the ones who benefit from a better community they themselves live in .

"First of all , I do not disagree with the statement of young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , and secondly , I think this statement is merely based on the stereotypes which the adults project on adolescents .

Nowadays , young people are acting more independent than their seniors .
They know more of what they want , why they want it and how they going to get it .
However , this change does not please most of the adults who still believe in the social hierarchy of age which is keeping juniors under control .
This is the crux of the problem , and in this case , the two paries see the title and definition of `` helping thier communities '' differently .

In my neighborhood , there is a brilliant young girl who has saved many children from domestic abuses .
Whenever Sara hears parents beating their kids in a much too violent way , she is brave enough to report to the authorities concerned about each severe case in the community .
Nevertheless , most of the adults complaint about her behavior to her parents , and Sara get grounded several times for rescueing bleeding children and even bruised infants .

Moreover , in my colleage years , I have seen students organizing clubs which aim at supervising the school 's recycling operaiont or urging more tree planting on campus .
Most of their schemes , even in their most well-designed and pratical form , are rejected .
The school 's reluctance to participate in such community reform activities shows a rather great contrast to the students ' effort and desire of changing the world into a paradise .

As far as I know , only young people of Sara 's age admire her devotion to the neighborhood , and the adults simply see her as a trouble .
Also , the club members in my college never give up any chance to come to the community 's aid despite the negativeness of the school .
These situations teach me a lesson about how aduts or the whole society will not always be right .
Young people from around the world all possess great passions in helping their communities to become a better place to live , and sometimes , they are even more enthusiastic than the grown-ups surrounding them .

"In my limited experience , it is quite true that more and more youngsers neglect their own communities and pay scarce time and attention on hepling their communities .
Personal speaking , I think that there are three possible causes of this results .
First , more youngsters are taught to study harder and focus on their schoolwork , and this may make them more self-centered because teachers and even their parents require them to pursue their own accomplishment or higher grades in every contests .
Thus the younsters surrouded only by this information gradually accept this thought and are less willing to attend the publich issues , like helping their communities .
Second , it might be possible that the youngsters spend their time with their own friends playing the basketball or baseball , studying and preparing for the exams , or something eles .
Whateve they do , they always take activities together , and stay in their own groups ; therefore , if the original goal of their groups is not to help their communities , they will never touch such issues .
We all know the power of the group to constrain the members to obey and do those things recognized by other members , so this would be one of the reasons that cause them unwilling to help their communities .
Last but not the least , such events may be caused by the lack of their passion to help others .
Our education system always uses the acheivement in the school performance or the grades in the exams to assess the potential of the students as a reference of selection in university entrance exam , and therefore both the students and their parents place this event a top priority , so no wonder there are less and less youngsters who devote themselves to the public issues and are happy to help others , including their communities .
In summary , I think it is the ignorance of public issues that causes them pay much attention on helping their communities .

"If you were to ask me whether young people nowaday give enough time to helping their communities , my answer would be definitely be a solid `` No '' .
At least it is the case for the young people of my country Taiwan .

There are two reasons why I feel that young people in Taiwan are not spending enough time in helping communities .
First , times have changed , the environment and the behavior of people have changed .
In comparison with the times when there are many children in a family , most families now have only one child .
His or her parents spend a lot of money and a lot of time providing his or her needs .
Most of the young people in Taiwan are being spoiled by their parents .
The young people , therefore , are selfish and inconsiderate .
They do n't feel it 's necessary to help the needy in their communities because they do n't think there are people that need to be helped .
It 's quite pathetic and sad , but it 's true .
How would they spend time helping in the communities when they do n't think there 's a need to it ?

The second reason why I do n't think young people give enough time to helping their communities is because there simply is n't time for them to do it !
Even if they want to help out , they do n't have time to do it !
Nowadays , young students have to learn a variety of things in school .
Aside from basic subjects like math , history and English , they have to perform well in other subjects like music and arts .
Students often go cram schools to learn their art and music skills after school .
When they get home , it 's usually around nine or ten o'clock .
Some teens even have to go to cram school on the weekends in order to get into better high school or universities .
Their schedules are already filled with subjects they need to handle in school , how can they have time to help out in the communities ?

The two reasons I mentioned why young people do n't spend enough time helping their communities are fair and true .
It is really a sad thing to point out , and I truly hope this situation will change in the near future .
Young people helping in communities is something that 's important and meaningful ; it would be a pity if no one helps out in the community .

"I am in complete agreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Although there are , of course , exceptions to this situation as with all other aspects of life , it appears quite clear to me that in general , youngsters these days simply do not have the time nor the interest to engage in community work .

Youngsters these days may not be required to plough the fields and run the family business as in olden days , but that does not necessarily translate into a sudden increase of free time .
As technology advances , youngsters suddenly find themselves in an increasingly competitive world , where every skill , every achievement is of the utmost importance .
Suddenly going to school is not enough ; students are pressured into scoring better than their peers , and this is achieved through sending youngsters to cram school .
Learning how to play the piano or dance ballet may have been a privilege in the past , but this is not so now .
All these `` extra '' skills have become commonplace - even necessary to ensure that one will not `` lose out '' in the long run .
This is where all the `` free time '' has gone to - trying to survive .
There are no more weekends ; only endless `` optional '' classes to go to .
Is it a wonder that young people nowadays do not appear to have enough time to help their communities ?

Another reason is pure apathy .
Young people are generally more self-centered than adults .
This is probably because we are all , in general , pampered from the time we were born until well into our adolescence .
Hence , youngsters , yet to face the harsh realities of life , are inevitably more narcissistic and fail to see how the welfare of `` other people '' is of any concern to them .
To them `` the community '' is something adults should manage and worry about .
These youngsters may read about the ongoing problems of their community in the papers everyday and still regard it all as happening in an unrelated place far , far away .
Parents are partly to blame in this matter .
By pressuring their children to be an overachiever in school , they have failed to instil the right amount of compassion and empathy in them .
Instead , children are brought up looking at life in terms of rewards .
Get good grades at school and mommy or daddy will give them a shiny new bike .
So when it comes to helping their communities , it all invariably boils down to the question : `` What do I get out of helping my community ? ''
.

Schools and other educational institutionals are equally to blame for moulding children into apathetic youngsters .
In certain less developed countries , such as Malaysia , children are required to learn `` moral studies '' in class .
However , it seems highly puzzling that students do not go out on trips to clean up the streets or hold charity sales for a good cause .
Instead , they are required to memorize specific words or phrases in order to get good grades during their finals .
Moreover , the examples used in the textbook do not keep up with the times .
Most of these examples still speak of villagers and broken wooden houses , and thus fail to reflect the situation in urban modern life .
Is it any wonder that students feel alienated from these `` community work '' and end up not doing enough of it ?

"`` Young peple nowafays do not give enough time to helping their communitites '' I believe this is untrue .
But I also believe that the ratio of people who do not help their communities of young people and adult are the same .
And these are as many adults who do not help to as many young people who do n't .

Many adults say that young people these days do n't help their communities enough .
To certain extent believe this is true and there are may young people who do not do these things , but i also believe that adults do not give enough time to helping their community too .
I do not think this is true everywhere , but I have seen a lot of adults in my area who do not participate at all to help their communities .
And I do not believe this is wrong because eveyone want their own spare time and do things that they like instead of sacrificing their time helping out the community .
So if adults do not want to sacrifice their time doing the work and do things they like , why should young people get some time to do things they like to do ?
So I really believe that adults and young people should not tell each other how they are not doing what they are suppose to do instead we should give eachother some space of our own .

Another reason that make this statement true is because adults are not showing us the right model .
As I mentioned , I have seen a lot of adults who do not participate at all in helping the communities , so the argument is if adults are not doing anything how can they order us to what they are not doing ?
Therefore I believe in order for young people to participate those activities , adults must first show the model to the young people , and eventually the young people will start to follow these adults as their models .

Overall I believe that helping out the communities and making them a better place is something good , and people do prefer these advantages , but what the adults should do first is not complaining about how young people are not doing what they are suppose to do but instead show the young people the right models so those young people will follow these modles togather making the communities nice places to live in .

"As a college student study in Taiwan , based on what I do in the past years and my observation on my friends , I agree with that young people nowadays actually do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I know I am kind of reluctant to admit the truth , yet I think the following reasons could explain why we are not able to do so .

In the first place , we are actually too busy in our school lifes .
As you know , people at this age are expected by elders or even by themselves to be as competitive as we could be .
This means we have to spend most of our time on taking lectures in different fields , learning precious experiences from dealing with club affairs , and some of us even already having internships in company .
In the rest of our time , there are a lot of reading materials and projects waiting to be treated .
And as a human being , we need time to play as well as to take a rest .
It is too hard for the young people to put their attention on the need of their communities if they are already bearing so many requirements .

The other reasons is that the concept of helping each other in a community has not yet formed in my culture .
I mean , it is not part of our life .
We are told since young to take care of yourself first then consider to give the rest to others .
So if a new idea is introducing to my country -- like encouraging youngsters to do something for the place they dwell in -- it must first serves as a requirement in school .
My college implemented a new policy last year that every students should earn at least 36 service hours before they can graduate .
Yet the service on school campus is also counted in the required hours .
The result is that , most of the students still do not learn the spirit of devoting to their community .

I know the fact is quite daunting to those who wish the new generation to do more to where it live in ; however , the reasons above which stop us from that also discourages me .
I hope things would get better

"It is of my opinion that helping communities is quite important for me .
With the concerning of the young people may not have enough time to devote themselves to helping their communites , I have several reasons and solutions as the followings

First , young people are energetic than the elders , they spend a lot of time in studying as well as playing .
They learn all the time and have the will to learn .
If they are asked to manage things with their neighbors , they will not refuse and hesitate to do .
In this prime time , young people like to help with each other to solve the problem .

Next to go would be , the definition of the communities may not simply mean the surroundings they live .
It can also be inferred the place they study and work .
Young people like to join clubs and learn something new in order to satisfy the thirst toward knowledge .
They concentrate with a specific field and lauch their efforts to achieve their ideal goal .
All these accomplishments need time and thier endeavor .

Moreover , they learn in helping .
Such as decorating a club center , recruiting new blood to the club , and even taking care of the sick classmate or neighbor preoccupied with business .

However , though they are so active in their community affair , there definitely are blind spots that they probably fail to focus on .
For example , young people who live outside may encounter the gap between them and their family .
For example , when I was an undergraduate who live far away from family , being not able to go home per week makes some communicational problems with my family members .

As a whole , young people do have enough time to helping thier communities .

"I agree with the statement that states young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their own communities because i feel that the youth of the nation in today 's scenario is more exposed to different things in life in terms of advancement in the technology and achievements in global comunications and world 's infrastructure .

The teenagers have greater accessibility to things in life than in early days .
The question of helping the society or do something beneficial for others seems less important to them , for many reasons that keep them preoccupied and also for the fact that nowadays , most parents do not teach their children about society 's development , hygeine and may also hardly find any peer groups who will be interested in any social activity .

What keeps them involved in themselves and staying aloof in their own world is the improvement in technology and communication where most teenagers would want to experiment new things and the urge of trying various new gadgets and the resources for gaining more knowlegde where they can boost to their peers .
The entertainment industry also plays a major role here where the youth would want to be updated with all da latest movies , T.V shows and music .
The arrival of networking systems and the internet gives the youth more accessibility to things in any part of the world at any time .
Within clicks , the information is present in front of them and be it on any subject matter .
The night life in pubs and clubbing is another method of socializing and keeping themselves partied with the high music blasts and tapping of the floor .
The sports is anther craze for the youth to be busy involved into , be it Formula1 Race , Football , Tennis or Cricket .

Therefore , with the entertainment packages and the encylopedia at their hand the youth nowadays hardly cares for their own society but themselves .
It is so much possible that they dont even find the time for the ocassional get togethers within their own communities .
Leave alone communities , may be for their own family members .
Everyone is so involved in their own daily tasks and routine , that even though it becomes mundane at a point , the youth will definately keep themselves occupied with something new to explore and learn .
But will not think of helping their own communities .

The youth are not to be blamed here completely as it requires the awarenes and the sense of responsibility towards their own society which can be brought only by their own parents and elders and ofcourse the education that they are receiving .
The shows on tv also to a certain extend do influence the youth .
Therefore , more shows and programs should be telecasted and more films should be made to bring about the awareness within the youth .

"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are two reasons .
First , young people nowadays tend to be raised to be more self-centered in capitalistic places .
They are being told , either directly or indirectly , that fulfilling personal desires or achieving personal gains is more important than helping communities .
In capitalistic places , people emphasize more about their personal abilities and achievements rather than their sense of devotion and caring to a larger group other than their companies .
Although our school systems and communities try to send out the opposite messages , individual competition and the collapse of the sense of cooperation are on the winning side .
Second , young people today are raised to be more spoiled .
They get what they want eaiser .
They are more indulged in their personal comforts and pleasures .
Many of them may consider helping communities a waste of time .
They may think , `` What would helping communities do me any good ?
That wo n't necessarily make my report cards or resumes look good .
Who cares about community service certicates ?
Besides , I will get more fun to hang around in a mall and eat ice cream with my friends ! ''
In my opinion , the most inner reason that they see no points of helping their communities is because they are not used to helping and giving , but more to receiving .
Nowadays , parents who raise children tend to ask less but give more and more easily .
When people start to raise fewer children , they make their only or few children the queens and kings of the families .
Modern parents ' indulgence creates more selfish and indifferent children , which is harmful to our communities and society .

"Gone is the age of closely-knitted society .
It is often suggested that nowadays , young people are less devoted to community sevice in terms of time .
In this essay , this statement will be examined in reasonably great depth .

For the purpose of effective analysis , clarification of the definition is needed .
What is the meaning of ` helping ' ?
In common sense , it means voluntary , unpaid , physical asistance such as taking care of the old people , cleaning public space and working for the underprivileged .
However , here , a broader definition is propsed .

The ` helping ' component also includes indirect assistance such as donation and political participation .
Also , what is ` enough ' ?
I propose that ` enough ' should be assessed with reference to the needs of the society .
Being members of society , young people are the most able and there the most willing group of potential helpers so whether the time devoted is enough should be judged on the basis of whether the help has met the needs of the society .

To begin with the ` common sense ' level , young people may really have given less time .
In modern societies , the overwhelming majority of young people tend to devote most of their spare time to personal entertainment such as TV games , pub gathering , disco nights etc ..
Although more time of entertainment is the natural and actually desirable result of the advancement of mankind , we cannot forget that to ensure the proper functioning of the society , young people also have the duty to help .
They benefit from the society so they should also benefit the society in return .
Therefore , the statement is true at common sense level .

However , the adoption of a broader definition of ` helping ' may lead to different result .
The increase in general education level undoubtedly has provided the young people with the necessary ability and awareness to participate in the liberal democratic system .
The young people can indirectly help the deprived by participating in social politics , by fighting for better social welfare , by lobbying the government for more resoruces and by acting as a bridge between the decision-makers and the people targeted by the policy .
Also , due to the high education level , many of the young people normally have a reasonably good income .
Obviously they can help the community in the form of regular and generous donation .
In wider context , they can act as the backbone of the economy and thereby generate enough economic resoruces for the social justice system .
They are just some of the ways in which the modern young people can help the society .

As to whether the current commitment of the young peole has satisfied the needs of the society , the answer is more uncertain .
Human wants are unlimited and the ones who need the help of young people are no exceptions .
Nevertheless , for pragmatic purpose , a reasonable line can still be drawn .
The current social justice system proves to be reasonably ` enough ' since it can provide most people with basic life-supporting stuffs such as food and shelter .
However , the answer to the question depends on the future performance of the social justice system which will be supported by the young people .

"Some people thinks that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities while some others thinks that they do .
For those who think they does give the reason that lots of young people would go out and do free survices for orphanage as well as other non profitable survices in educational commities and etc .
For example we can see that lots of students enter clubs or teams that goes out around the neighborhood to help out those who are in need .
This can be seen much more clearly at US and North America .

However for those who think that the young people does n't do enough survices point out that most young people just focus on their own leisure activities when they have free time or just go and get more work to earn more money instead of paying attention to the communities .
For example they give out the fact that young people nowadays spend more and more time on surfing the internet as well as doing sport instead of free community survices since that they do n't actually get any benifit from it .

As for me , I personally agrees to the idea that young people nowadays do n't spend enough time to help out for their communities , on the conditions that they are living in Asia or non English speaking countries .
The fact is that in non speaking countries such as Asia young people tends to focus more on school work and how to get better degree such as master degree or PHD .
However in North America , the school requires the student to help out the communities at least 2 ~ 5 hours a semester , which means while those young people goes to school they receives the idea of helping out the communities instead of just focus on the academics .

"Although I 'm a young person myself , I have to agree with the statement with a heavy heart .

The lack of participation in community service among young people results mainly from lack of time .
I am currently a student in a competitive high school , and the demand of schoolwork allows me very little free time .
School begins at 7:40 in the morning and ends at 5:10 in the afternoon .
Since I live very far from the school I attend , I have to commute by train for three hours each day .
When I reach home , it 's almost 7:00 pm .
The sun has set , the sky has darkened , the community is almost asleep , and I have tons of homework to do .
There is neither time nor opportunity for me to help out in my community , regardless of how much I want to serve and contribute .

Most high school students in the United States have finished hundreds of hours of community service before they graduate from high school .
Colleges in the U.S. often consider the hours spent on community service when evaluating an applicant , emphasizing the importance of a student 's willingness to serve his or her community .
Colleges in Taiwan , however , put very little emphasis on community service when viewing applications .
Instead , test scores and academic accomplishments are given major consideration .
Students devote their time and energy to activities that colleges find more important and neglect those that are thought trivial , resulting in a lack of dedication to community service .

Some high schools in Taiwan require their students to finish a certain amount of community service hours each year .
The minimum my high school sets for us is 8 hours each semester .
Students use the little free time they have during summer and winter vacations to finish the required hours of community service , doing simple jobs such as sweeping up fallen leaves , volunteering at the local library or tidying up the lobby .
Students have no time to participate in more meaningful and long-term communty services , such as helping out each day at the local day care center , orginizing a group to reinforce the recycling habits of residents , or tutoring for free at a public middle school .

From my observations and personal experiences , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is a regrettable situation , but it is a situation that canbe improved if students are given more free time and a stronger sense of community .
That way , students will be able to participate more in community service and receive a wonderful experience by spending time helping others and building a better community .

"It is true that nowadays , school gives out more work for students to do .
And most of the students are packed with school work that they do not have spare time to do other things .
Even though it is true , I still believe young people are putting enough time to help their communities .

As for my school , an average students spend about four to five hours on their homework , and it depends on the level of the difficulties of the courses they took .
But , even though our homework takes up a great time , many students from my school still work for community services .
My school ends at 3 pm everyday , but we have activities that is offer after school , such as community services .
And most of the students are `` forced '' to do community services .
There 's no rules set on the minimum hours worked per year , but for those people who wish to get into good college , would do community service everyday .
Because we know , colleges care about community services .

Of course , there are people who help out in their communities just because of their interest .
You might ask , `` why would people enjoy doing community services when there are better alternatives such as watching movies and chilling out with your friends ? ''
The reason you would have asked the question is because you have not found a community service that you can enjoy doing .
I have been persistantly going to Leprosy Home everyweek .
I worked about seventy hours every year .
College Application might be one of the reason I visit there , but the main reason that keeps me spending so much time there is because of the residents there .
Even though most of the residents had never gone to school before , there 're things that I can learn from them , such as , the way to live and look at your life .
They are disabled , and they have been through all sorts of difficulties , and while chatting with them , they 'll share their storys of how they 'd gone through all the difficulties .
And that 's why there are people who enjoy helping out the communities - they learn many things that they do n't usually learn from school .

May be , around the world , young people do not give enough time helping their communities .
But from the environment I live in , I see people doing communities almost everyday .
Some of them might be forced by their parents or college application , but those people are still the same as those who do communities with interest .

"In the old days the communities almost equal to the whole world people are living in .
Therefore , there are strong connections between people and their communities .
However , nowadays , things have changed a lot .
As a global village , people can communicate with others who are far away .
The connections with communities seems not as important as before .
That makes the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

In modern world , there are so many things happen at the same time , and people usually only concern with those things have strict relationship with themselves .
For example , in the communities , we often see that it is always the older people who participate in the work .
Why ?
It is because compared to the community work , the young people have many other things are more important to them to accomplish , such as studying and making money .
It seems that all their time are occupied by these things already .

In the long run , the whole society seems to adapt this phenomena .
Also , gradually it has build up a wrong concept that because there are other things more important than community work , young people do not have to be responsible to their communities .
They not only do nothing to help the communities , but also sometimes wastes the resourses provide in the communities .
In other words , because of the wrong value of the society , instead of doing something good for the communities , the young people do someting harm to the communities .

Therefore , I think it is important to change this misthinking .
Parents should take their children to help their communities togather .
When they are used to doing this , they would not use `` no time '' to be an excuse for not take part in the work .

Because of this , many people have the impression that young people nowadays are spoiled and selfish .
However , I think this is an unfaired opinion .
Amittedly , there are spoiled breds among young people , but most of them are willing , and even eager , to spending time to help their communities .

Firstly , the vibrancy of local and international community-involvment programs ( CIPs ) proves that young people nowadays are willing to help their communities .
For example , in many schools , the response for short-term or even long-term CIPs is often so overwhelming that selection proess is necessary .
Also , many students are willing to get out of their comfort zone to help out in villages where living conditions are extremely poor .
This shows their willingness to spend their time to help more .

Secondly , many students are commited to various programs over a very long period of time .
For example , some students in Singpore continue to be a member of the Interact Club from secondary school to junior college , over six years .
They typically take part in different programs , for example , giving out tuitions or helping our at an old folks ' home , twice a week .
Again , these students show that young people are willing to sacrifice a large amout of time for their communities .

Thirdly , many young people have the intention to be social workers , or at least volunteers .
Those who have participated in CIPs or other volunteery work find such activities enrich their experiences .
While they help the weak groups in their communities , they gain satsifaction of helping others .
As a result , they want to do more and even condier social worker as a career choice .
A social worker at her twenties I know had the aspiration of being a social worker after she started in a program for ophans .
She felt strongly to commit more time after graduating from university .
Thus , young people do give time to help their communities .

As they benefit from society , they want to give back , too .

"I oppose to the saying that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because they are given more time and chances to help others in their communities and they indeed do so .
The reasons also includes the fact that it is hard to define how much time for young people is `` enough '' in helping others in their communities .
My opinion is that helping in communities , anyway , is not supposed to be the center of the life of young people .

First of all , it should be noticed that more and more educational system take community service as a part of tasks that students have to do .
By doing this , students , in fact , are given more time and chances to help others in their communities .
And in reality , it works well in many systems .
Take my personal experience as an example .
In my high school , everyone has to choose at least one service called `` social service '' .
Instead of having classes in afternoons , we go to local families , primary schools , immigrants centers to help others of the community .
My social service is going to `` School of Peace '' every Friday afternoon and playing with the children there .
My classmates and I spent a lot of time there last semester .
Therefore , saying that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping communities is too general and regardless of the better reality .

Secondly , some people might ask , `` how much time should young people spend in helping their communities ? ''
It is hard to say and define .
However , it is widely accepted that the focus of young people should be studying .
If a youth does not have enough knowledge or skill , how can he or she help the others ?
In their age , they are supposed to expose themselves to different fields of knowledge and take advantages from them .
Later in their life , after they are fully educated , they will have chances , time and wish to devote themselves to helping others in their communities .

To sum up , I think that now young people are spending a lot of time in helping their communities and the time is enough .
On one hand , being involved in community service is becoming a part of education in increasing number of education systems .
The youths are spending a lot of time in communities .
On the other hand , the time that have been used by them to community service is enough already for the fact that learning is the primary task that they should focus on at their age anyway .

"In my personal opinion , it is true that most of the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are mainly two reasons that accounts for this phenomena .
One is that young people today concern more about their self-interests than the interests of the community .
The onther reason is that yongsters today are more aloof with people around them .

Some adults blame the education , and some blame the society for the characteristics that young people bear nowadays .
Adults believe these adolescents to be selfish and care only what they are interested in , and what will beneifit them most because our education do not emphasis on caring people and communities .
Youngsters never show interest in helping their communities because they do n't think they have anything to do with their communites .
They do n't believe that the community will do them any good or will benefit on them .
Many have strong concept that if they spend time and get involve in helping the communities , troubles will come .
The more one involves , the more things waits you to help .
And finally , your time is deprived and that your own work wo n't get done .

On the other hand , there 's a weird notion which sometimes spread through television programs that makes young people feel more aloof with people around them .
The reason is that by showing much compassion and enthusiasm in helping the commuty may sometimes result in an unecessary troubles .
There are many news broadcasts reporting that people get kidnapped or robbed when they are helping others to find way home , or helping those who pretend to be injured .
These things happens so often that people are scared and unwilling to help others .
Thus finally , people become more aloof with each other inorder to protect oneself from being harmed .

All in all , selfishness and coldness of the young people taday make them unwilling to devote themselves to public interests , like helping their communities .
The fact is that community interests does not concern them , and they are afraid of being hurt .
They do n't want to devote on things that wo n't pay them back .

In my opinion , I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier communities .
As a young girl , I do n't think that I can give enough time to help my community .
Here comes some reasons .

First of all , young people nowadays have more vivid personalities than decades ago .
In this situation , young people try their best to be themselves and do everything they want to do .
So they may have fewer time and may be unwilling to helping their communities just because they think it is stupid or rediculous if they help thier communuties .
In other words , they think that helping their communitis is not the thing that a young man should do .
For example , young people in my country indicates that young people should go outside and try something new and exciting , not just stay at home or in communities .
Participating activities of communities is the thing that old people do .
Although this may not be a correct idea , it really influence you

In addition , as advanced technology is invented and applied , there are more and more activities that young people can do .
But we only have 24 hours a day and it led to a fewer time to hepling our communities in contrast .
For example , we can go see a movie or go riding , go kloofing , or even attand to a big computer game competition .
There are too many things for we young people to try and to experience .
That is , we can hardly get eough time helping our communities because there are more and more interesting and exciting activities that appeal to us .

To summarize , young nowadays really do n't give enough time to help their communities .
But this does n't mean that we do n't love our own community , afterall , there are too many things enchant us .
We have the right to participate an activity that is really interesting to us and this may help us to learn more and experience mor from it .

"Nowadays the burden placed on the youth is indeed much heavier than that on the previous generations .
However , I disagree with the statement .
In my opinion , the young people , at least in Singapore where I am currently studying , do contribute to their communities with great passion and enthusiasm .

First of all , the youth 's passion to serve the communities can be evident in the large number of voluntary activities they are involved in .
Almost every secondary or high school student participates in community service on a regular basis .
They either go to the community library to do clean-ups and shelving , or they go to the `` Old Folks Home '' to interact with the old people there and ensure these people have fun and joy .
The musical groups in some schools may also organise concerts for the public , and donate the profit made to charity organisations .
The regular involvement of the youth in voluntary community service undoubtedly demonstates their enthusiasm and effort in helping their coummunity .

More importantly , the government also places a great emphasise in ensuring the young people to give sufficient time to helping their communities .
The Ministry of Education introduces the `` Community Involvement Programme '' ( short-termed CIP ) , where students must contribute to their communities in some form , and the time of their contribution is reported by the related organisations .
This time , known as `` CIP hours '' , is an important element in the assessment of a student .
If one does not fulfill the minimun requirement of CIP hours , he may not be admitted by a good high school or college .
This education policy ensures that the young people contribute enough time to helping their communities .

Furthermore , the effort of school and society is also crucial in making sure that the youth contribute enough to the communities .
In school , desirable social values such as care for those in needs are taught to students so that they can become better citizens .
Teacher encourage and guide students to carry out service learning projects , in which they either serve a particular group of people as mentioned earlier , or they can raise funds for charity organisations .
Some companies facilitate these service learning projects by providing initial fundings and organising competitions .
For instance , one company , `` IE Singapore '' , organises a competiton in which they provide 1000 dollars initial fund to each participating group .
These groups are supposed to use the fund and come out with a creative way to raise more money for charity organisations .
The group raising the greatest sum wins .
Personally I participated in this competition last year .
We used the funding to buy raw materials and made them into different shapes of balloons .
It selt well and after 4 months of hard work , we were able to raise over 90000 dollars fund .
We donated the money to Children 's Cancer Foundation .

In conclusion , nowadays young people are having great academic burdens and more demanding requirements , but their effort to helping the communities is not sacrificed .
They devote enough time in coummunity service in voluntary activities , under the education policy of the government , and as inspired by school and society .

"I agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I myself is reluctant to participate in community activities .
The reasons are varied .
For example , the Mid Autumn Festival is coming , the bar-be-cue seems just not so interesting to attend because you need to do it with a group of elderly people .
Community borad often expects young adults to do all kinds of chores simply because they are younger and more engetic .
It is true but young people lose their interests in attending under this logical consequence .
If a communitiy only expects young people to contribute rather than gain benefits , why would young adults join the activities it offers .

Community activities are usually designed for families in the neighbordhood .
The subjects would be natually grandparents , parents and children .
It costs a lot to design a program that is suitable for everyone 's needs .
If each house as a unit to decide what they want to do within their own budget , it will attract more interests for people to spend their holidays .
Besides , community 's activities are very limited in kind .
They may just have kraok , bar-b-cue and riddles .
I would believe young adults will chose what is suitable for them outside of the community and have fun as much as possible , such as KTV instead of kraok or movie .
It may be even more exciting by going to a bar and drink to their upmost with their close friends .
After all , it is much more fun in the world outside than the daily in and out neighborhood .

One major issue in community is garbage .
Not every community has a good system of running recycle items .
People have the tendency to leave their garbages in a certain spot where nobody is at the scene seeing them do that .
Graduately , it becomes a trash mountain .
It is very common in Taiwan .
With issue like this , community needs volenteers to guard the spot and supervise the dumping process when trash truck comes .
Young adults have energy to do that but they are not so respectable enough to argue with elderly ladies or men .
It increases the reluctances for young people to interact with their neighbours .
It is reasonable that young people keep their noses out of community board .
It is just too much to handle to a young adult .

"Advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping consumers' perceptions of products and influencing their purchasing decisions. However, I agree with the statement that most advertisements tend to make products seem much better than they really are. This practice is prevalent across various industries and can have significant implications on consumers.

One reason why advertisements often exaggerate the qualities of products is the competitive nature of the market. Companies are constantly vying for consumers' attention and loyalty, leading them to highlight only the positive aspects of their products while downplaying any shortcomings. For example, a fast-food commercial may showcase a perfectly crafted burger that looks much more appetizing on screen than in reality.

Moreover, the use of persuasive tactics and visually appealing imagery in advertisements can create unrealistic expectations among consumers. When products fail to meet these exaggerated standards, customers may feel disappointed and misled. For instance, a skincare ad promising flawless skin may not disclose the extensive use of filters and editing to achieve the desired effect.

In conclusion, while advertisements serve as a crucial tool for promoting products, it is essential for consumers to approach them with a critical mindset. By being discerning and conducting independent research, individuals can make informed purchasing decisions and avoid falling prey to misleading advertising tactics.

It is imperative for consumers to be vigilant and consider multiple sources of information before making purchasing decisions. By staying informed and aware, individuals can navigate the complexities of the advertising landscape and make choices that align with their needs and expectations.",P4,CHI,high,1
"Have you ever found yourself buying a product based on an advertisement, only to be disappointed by its actual performance? Many people believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion, I agree with this statement due to several reasons.

Firstly, advertisements often use persuasive techniques such as exaggerated claims, selective editing, and celebrity endorsements to create a glamorous image of the product. For example, a skincare commercial might showcase flawless models claiming miraculous results, leading consumers to believe that using the product will instantly transform their skin.

Secondly, advertisements tend to highlight only the positive aspects of a product while downplaying its limitations or side effects. This can create unrealistic expectations among consumers, ultimately leading to dissatisfaction when the product fails to meet those expectations.

Lastly, the goal of advertisements is to sell a product, not necessarily to provide an accurate representation of its quality or effectiveness. Therefore, advertisers may resort to manipulative tactics to lure consumers into making a purchase.

In conclusion, most advertisements do indeed make products seem much better than they really are by using persuasive techniques, selective information, and a focus on sales rather than transparency.

One reason for this is that advertisers use various techniques such as selective editing, exaggerated claims, and celebrity endorsements to create a glamorous image of the product.

Furthermore, advertisements often focus on selling a lifestyle or image associated with the product rather than the product itself. This can create unrealistic expectations among consumers, leading to disappointment when the product fails to deliver the promised results.

"Advertisements have a powerful ability to transform mundane products into seemingly extraordinary ones. I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This is primarily due to the persuasive techniques employed by advertisers to captivate consumers and drive sales.

One common technique used in advertisements is exaggeration. Products are often portrayed as having exaggerated benefits or features that may not necessarily reflect reality. For example, a simple face cream may be marketed as a ""miracle solution"" that promises to reverse aging overnight, creating unrealistic expectations among consumers.

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on selective showcasing of information. They highlight only the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any drawbacks or limitations. This one-sided presentation can create a skewed perception of the product's actual value and efficacy.

Moreover, the use of enhanced visuals and celebrity endorsements can also contribute to the exaggeration of a product's appeal. By associating a product with glamorous lifestyles or famous personalities, advertisers create a sense of desirability that may not align with the product's actual quality.

For example, a fast-food commercial may show a perfectly crafted burger with fresh ingredients, but fail to mention the high levels of sodium and unhealthy fats in the meal.

Exaggerated claims are another way advertisements deceive consumers. Companies use superlatives and hyperbole to make their products seem extraordinary. For instance, a skincare product may claim to erase wrinkles overnight, when in reality, it may only provide temporary effects.

Appealing visuals also play a significant role in making products seem better than they are. Advertisements often use attractive models, vibrant colors, and enticing settings to create a desirable image of the product, even if the actual product may not live up to the portrayed image.

One common technique used in advertisements is the use of exaggerated claims and promises.

They may use flashy visuals, celebrity endorsements, and exaggerated claims to capture the attention of consumers. For example, a skincare product advertisement might promise ""flawless skin in just one week,"" creating unrealistic expectations that the product may not live up to in reality.

Furthermore, the goal of advertising is to drive sales, and portraying a product in the best possible light is essential for achieving this objective. As marketing expert Phillip Kotler once said, ""The art of marketing is the art of brand building. If you are not a brand, you are a commodity."" This emphasis on branding often leads to embellishments and exaggerations in advertisements to create a strong brand image.

In conclusion, the primary purpose of advertisements is to persuade consumers to buy a product, and this often involves making the product appear better than it actually is. Consumers should approach advertisements with a critical eye and not always take the claims at face value.",P4,CHI,high,1
"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements are carefully crafted to highlight the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or completely ignoring any negative aspects. This can create unrealistic expectations for consumers and lead to disappointment when the product does not live up to the hype.

One reason for this is that advertisers have a vested interest in selling their products, so they will do whatever it takes to make them appear as appealing as possible. For example, cosmetic companies often use heavily photoshopped images of models to promote their products, creating an unattainable standard of beauty that can only be achieved with their products.

Furthermore, advertisers use persuasive language and emotional appeals to manipulate consumers into believing that their products will solve all their problems. As Jean Kilbourne, an author and filmmaker specializing in the portrayal of women in advertising, once said, ""Advertisements are an environmental force that is so powerful that it changes the way we think, feel, and act, often without our conscious awareness.""

In conclusion, most advertisements are designed to make products seem much better than they really are in order to drive sales. Consumers should approach advertisements with a critical eye and not take everything at face value.",P4,CHI,high,1
"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements are carefully crafted to appeal to consumers' emotions and desires, often exaggerating the benefits of a product while downplaying its drawbacks. This can create unrealistic expectations and lead to disappointment when the actual product does not live up to the advertised promises.

One example of this is in the beauty industry, where airbrushed models and celebrities endorse skincare products that claim to erase wrinkles or clear acne overnight. In reality, these products may provide only temporary or minimal results, if any. Another example is in the food industry, where fast-food commercials depict mouth-watering burgers that look nothing like the soggy, squished reality you receive at the drive-thru.

Advertisers use persuasive techniques such as catchy slogans, attractive visuals, and celebrity endorsements to create an illusion of perfection around a product. Consumers should approach advertisements with a critical eye, considering the source and doing their own research before making purchasing decisions.

In conclusion, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of the manipulative tactics used in advertisements to make informed choices. By questioning the exaggerated claims and doing independent research, we can avoid falling victim to misleading advertising practices.

Therefore, I urge everyone to approach advertisements with skepticism and critical thinking to avoid being swayed by false promises and exaggerated claims.",P4,CHI,high,1

"No matter where you go , you 'll always be confronted with huge commercial signs .
Even your favorate television programmes are filled with subtle advertising tricks .
The huge amount of commercials and the way in which the products are presented has often made me wonder if the products are truely as amazing as they look .
And I often come to the conclusion that most products truely are too good to be true .
The advertisements make them better than they really are .

First of all , you must keep in mind that the advertisement serve for one purpose and one purpose only and that is selling the product , no matter what .
In order to do so , advertisers tend to exaggerate and brag .
By telling amazing stories about the products , they try to sell them .
Of course , nobody wants to buy ordinary products that have no use anyway .

Besides , there are a lot of products of the same kind in the markets .
So there need to be distinction between them .
People want to know which one is the best , because everyone wants only the best of the best .
And a lot of advertisements do make a product extraordinary .
Take the commercials for make-up for example .
People often tend to buy overprized make-up rather than the cheap ones .
That 's because they see and hear celebrities talk about those ` amazing ' cosmetic products .
I 'm sure you 've seen Andie Mcdowell starring in the L'Oreal commercials promoting facial cream : `` This will definitely make your rincles dissappear .
You 'll see instant results !
This is the best ! ''
It perhaps really is n't the best facial cream , or even different from the other creams , but the celebrity makes it special .

Finally , modern technology plays a big roll in the scheme .
the use of photoshop has made people and products look better and prettier than they really are .
It 's very easy to manipulate pictures .
And the advertisers know that .
It 's so commonly used nowadays , that you will hardly find any ` natural ' pictures anymore .

It 's always fun to watch the commercials , though .
Seeing how the companies have outdone themselves again and again .
They always find new ways of entertaining the audience , trying to get your attention .
Having singing children and perfect families playing in the commercials .
They 're fun to watch , but they 're definitely not representative for th

So all with all , be very cautious when buying products .
Do n't buy everything the commercials tell you to buy , as these products are often too good ot be true !
Remember that these adds are often misleading and exaggerated .
The advertisers want you to buy their products and will do anything to get them sold .
Using modern technology and paying celebrity , they manipulate the public opinion .
Enjoy the commecials , but do n't let them fool you .

"Nowadays , we are more and more affected by the advertisements in our everyday life , in which we can hardly avoid facing them .
Some people would deem that most advertisements are very acurate and truely display the quality of the products , others , in contrast , totally disagree with it which is also my point of view .
There are numerous reasons to support my idea and I would like to introduce two of the most conspicuous ones .

First , the purpose of advertisement desides its nature .
We know that the advertisements are used for introduction , for which tons of money are invested by the companies to make their products well-known and popular .
What they expect are the profits , they need the commercials to bring in more money .
So of course they want to show the customers the best sides of their products , while some times it is true and may not so appliable in other conditions .
Take the soda pepsi for example , in the commercials the pepsi seems like to be so cool and so delicious and drinkable , it can wipe out all of your heat within , but actually any kinds of beverage can make it .
So the nature of advertisement for making more profits for the company make it display the best point of one product , which make the products seem much better .

It might be too arbitrary to deside that most advertisements are `` fake '' only by what I listed above .
Another reason for my inclination that they are not so accurate lies in the effect of stars .
The commercials tend to hire stars as their spokesman , for example , the film stars , sports stars and beautiful models .
The results are very obvious , make the customs to believe that they can become stars if they use the same products , which is an additional function that the product cannot actually provide .
Take a certain brand of eye cream for example , if in the advertisement Nicole Kidman is introducing this brand , customers will tend to believe that that eye cream will make them as fabulous as Nicole , while sadly they may not be .
So the effect of the product is enhanced by the stars , resulting in the relatively fake impression to the buyers that the product is better .

All in all , based on what we have discussed above , we can get the conclusion that although most of the advertisements are true , but the added effect may be fake to some extend .

"Why , you may wonder , should we purchase items according to advertisements ?
When facing this decision whether or not to believe an advertisement , somebody will claims that they trust these things , but others , in constrast , will believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than their practical situations .
From my point of view , I 'd like to choose the second one and my arguments are listed as follows .

First of all , an important reason why I hold confidence on this view is that the advertisements always states how well their products are .
They may claim that they company has a strong background and what they produce may have some perfect effects .
However can you believe that there is something perfert in the world ?
Usually , their words are not true .
For example , there is a famous company , Odian Company in China , which is focusing on the production of modern floors .
In its advertisement , It claims that its commander center is located in Germany , but this have been disapproved by a newpaper .
Therefore , how can we believe the advertisement like that ?

Furthermore , another reason for my inclination for my view is that we can not find the beautiful characteritics stated in advertisements .
That is to say ; when we buy one item and begin to use it , we may find that these `` splendid '' characteristics disappers and some new problems arise .
From a practical point of view , the advertisements will always blow up in order to make money .
For instance , one of my classmates has ever brought an air condition .
According the statement of the advertisement , it will not produce much noice .
However , his practical experience proved that it is not easy to fall sleeping if this machine is turned on .

Of course , an advertisement can tell us something useful .
For a new product , a good advertisement can help the customers to learn some detailed things about it and spread its impacts in the society .
Specially , to some extent , I 'll agree that the statements in a couple of advertisement may be consistent with the real features .
However , if all the aspects are contemplated , it seems advisable for us to believe that most advertisements will blow up .

In a word , although advertisements can supply some useful information , most of them are blowing up in order to make profits .
What they claim just try to tell something unture to make their products more attactive .
From all the above arguments , we can reach the conclusion , that most advertisement will blow up in their introduction .

"With the fast pace of development of human civilization , more and more people pay attention to the advertisements of prodects .
Presently , numerous people are willing to buy products based on the information delivered from the advertisements because the products seem appealing in these advertisements .
However , from my own experiences , I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Recently , the products appear in advertisements become more and more attractive due to their well decorated appearence .
People have the desire to buy things that look beautiful but at the same time , they will loss the awareness about how good the products will be .
For example , I had bought a pair of sneakers because they are colourful and be placed in a delicated box .
Actually , they looked really good .
However , the endurance of the sneakers was out of my imagination .
I just had worn them twice and both soles were broken .
Unforturnally , I was cheated by the advertisement .
Sometimes , advertisement of the appearence of a product is not reliable .

Moreover , people will ignore some significant information if they completely believe advertisement .
It is obvious that the manufacture will not show the disadvantages of their products in the advertisements and people have to observe the real quality of a product by their own .
This is also the reason that many social organizations doing a variety of experiments on a single product in order to discover the secrets behind advertisement .
Actually , people need socialy authority to help them to choose products due to the immense unclear advertisements spread out in our society .
Conspicuously , the existence of this kind of organization helps customers to clearfy the some of the fake condition created by advertisements .

To sum up , people should become aware about the advertisements they see and hear everyday because most of them contain fake and unclear information .
If we accidentally trust a unreliably advertisement , the outcome is unconceiveable .

"Yes , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
The nature of advertisements is to sell , be it a consumer product or a political message .
In order to sell , advertisements often exhibits the following features :

First of all , advertisements often create an attractive image associated with the product to their consumers or their audience .
Advertisements , especially those TV ads with sound and picture , often present the products to consumers in a more appealing way .
For example , an advertisement for Nextle Coffee in China .
The TV ad has several handsome young men and elegant young women sipping coffee with a background soundover `` great flavor , great taste ! ''
.
People in China watched this ad unconsciously have the impression that cool , trendy , handsome people drink coffee .
The sales of Nextle coffee shot up after the ad .
Though tea is more popular in China , yet the attractive image presented in the ad lured many tea drinkers to buy Nextle coffee .
They want to be associated with the trend .
In this case , advertisements here add halo effect to the products .

Secondly , advertisements often use image leader to convey appealing message to their audience .
For example , Nike 's TV ad with Michael Jordon playing a basket ball accompanying the Nike logo and `` just do it '' message is very tempting .
People feel that wearing Nike shoes , they can be more successful .
It creats an illusion .
Because people admire Jordon and they want to buy the shoe brand he is wearing .
Here , Jordon is the image leader .
People follow suit .
People want to identify themselves with famous people .

Finally , advertisements often only mention the positive things about the products and ignore or downplay the side effects or negative aspects of the produccts .
For example , ads for drugs .
`` Ask your doctor if this medicine is for you '' instead of mentioning the side effects .

In sum , advertisements are marketing tools .
They cannot truly reflect what products they are .
They often elevate the products .

"Advertisement is now regarded as one of the greatest industries in the twenty first century .
The foundamental philosophies of advertisements are obvious-to create a better impression of the product the advertisement is describing in the minds of potential customers .
As communication technologies and psychology theories advanced considerably over the last century , the effects and power of the advertisements outfitted with high sophisticated computer generized amazing visual scenes and sound effects , grew more and more powerful in convincing the customers that `` this '' product is wonderful , inpeccable , to a extent often exceeds the reality !

Even about ten years ago , this unbelievable strength of advertisement had emerged for a long time .
I remember that when I was a child in elementary school ( probably the second grade ) , I was fascinated with the afternoon advertisement of the Little Sun beverage .
The TV advertisement created a false image that the bottle of the soda , which , of course delicately decorated with wings , could really fly , and a lot of children could follow it and find a mysterious land in which they could enjoy playing there with catoon stars .
However , when I got this bottle as my birthday gift , I was disillusionised that it is JUST a toy , not a creature of any kind .
Therefore , I hereby denounce the tricks employed in the advertisements that beautify products inproperly .

Moreover , we can see the capacity of advertisement to exaggarate the merits of the products by discussing the process of the advertisement creation .
First , a market survey is conducted , in which the subconscious desires of people are analysed and taken advantage of .
For example , the common illnesses are severe impediment for people who travel around all the time , so the advertisers know that if they could trigger the travelers subconcious fear of getting sick during their trips by citing a example in which a officer is assigned an extremely crucial job oversea , and any delay can cause a dreadful lose of his firm 's profit .
In this case , a illness can be a so terrible happening that the person want to avoid desperately , and now , a tricky advertiser can manipulate the story .
He can say that by taking a kind of medicine , the traveler avoided a disease which would bother him if he had n't eat the pills .
Thereby , by constructing this plot , it seemed that the pill worth a lot , because `` without this pill , the company would lose a hundred million because the man taking responsibility would be impeded by severely illness '' , However , this impression is false and a pill is just a pill not comparable to a million dollars , but learned advertisers can link a pill with a hundred million dollars in the mind of the consumers subconsciously .
As a result , the advertisment created a image that the pill which in fact worth only a cent can be as valuable as a million dollars , which is horribly better than the pill itself !
Second , the visual image produced by highly developed computer technologies entitle the advertisements to penetrate the watchers ' defenses .
When we watch a advertisement , we conduct a analysis of how valuable this product is by using our past experiences and knowledges .
However , those grandiose images can easily confuse our mind and hinder our ability to reason effectively .
Therefore , by obstruct of own capacity of define how good a product is for ourselves , the advertisement actually confuses us and gives us a false image about the products , and the advertisers have no motivation to create the false image inferior than the reality .

"I think people usually buy products because of attractive advertisement .
But most products are worse than sample on the advertisement .
Therefore , I agree with the topic -- most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First of all , salers always tell customers how great the products are .
They can make a magic story to show how products work .
For example , one time I went to a cusmetic store , and the clerk told me their product was good , it could make my skin better .
After I used it for a week , I did n't think so .
It was not useful , and it was very expensive .
I was really angry about that .

Second , advertisement companies know how to design the product and advertisement to attract people .
In addition , they know how to persude the customers and make many programs , such as buy one get one , or coupons .
For instance , those programs usually attract women and teenagers .
But they always regret after they bought those products .

Third , advertisement companies usually make a survey to understand what kind of products will be popular .
And they try to make a perfect product in a reasonable price on the advertisement .
When customers see the advertisement , or hear from their friends or co-workers , they will rush to buy without thinking .

In my opinion , I usually think twice before I buy something .
It is necessary to consider about that .
As I have many experiences , I do n't want to waste money on those unuseful things anymore .
Now , if I really want to buy something , I always ask my friends or look up information on the internet .
Salers just want to earn money , they can tell you all advantages of their products , and after you bought it , you will find out how terrible it is .
Therefore , I support the idea -- most products seem better on the advertisement than they really are .

"Advertisements exploit people 's curiosity and desires and beguiles customers into spending money on worthless objects .
Many advertisements contain untrustworthy informations that appear appealing to customers .
Advertisements often make thing that `` you have always wanted and need . ''
By doing so , costumers are victims of these pleasing masks .

Advertisements always make diet machines seem to be the panacea of all stubborn fats and even social problem .
`` Lost 10kg in a month '' repeatly appears on television .
This repeation incalcates the customers ' s minds and made them into believing that this diet machine is the best .
Many diet machine advertisements also stress that their machine will work even the user does not cut down food input and that no other exercising is required .
However , there is not such a `` well-rounded '' machine that would make the user loss weight while he or she is consumming thousands of calories .
Therefore , they is no way such a diet machine is as good as it is presented in the advertisement .

Advertisement on tea stresses that tea is the panacea to all diseases .
It cures high blood pressure , headache , depression , and even cancer .
Any educated person know that there is no way that tea can cure cancer .
However , advertisement grasps people 's desire to living as long as possible and exploits this desire to increase their own profits .
Although many people are aware that tea has no direct influence on cancer , they would still like to buy such tea just because they doubt about their own knowledge and that it is better believe that advertisement than their own knowledge .
Therefore , advertisement benefits by controling the psychological effects on people .

If everything is as good as it appears on advertisement , we would have lived in a perfect world without any suffering or death since every thing seems to be the panacea to sufferings or death .
It is left to people 's own judgements to be decieved or not to be decieved by advertisements and by their own doubts .

"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Most people will not doubt about it , while others think quite differently on the issuse of the advertisements do n't make products seem much better .
Personally , I stand on the side of the advertisement make products seem much better .
There are three conspicuous concepts as follows .

Firstly , this is because of the simple fact that the examples you will meet in your life .
Many many times , when we see the advertisements in the TV or any where , the products in the advertisement are very perfect , excellent , so after receiving them , you are very disappointed .
The real products are not like the patterns in the advertisements .

Secondly , we could cite another ordinary example of that the advertisements are also the businesses , they also want to get the money from the customers .
So sometime , when they do the advertisements , they do n't worry about the quality of the products , and maybe they do n't understand the detail informations about the products , they just focus on how do the advertisements , how to make the customers to trust what they said .

Thirdly , I may say that the advertiser are not the experts about the different areas .
So they just need to make the advertisements look better , and let the customers believe the products , let the producer get the maximum profits , this is the rule of the market .

Certainly , some advertisements also do the good job .
They just tell the truth about the products to customers .
And try not to give the wrong information to public .
So some people believe that most advertisements do n't make products seem much better than they really are .

Of course , arguments will be against my standpoints , many people might argue that my opinions also have some drawbacks , Such as there are still some good advertisements .
I might reply that most important things are multifaceted , there are many alternatives to choose from , each with uniqe advantanges and disadvantanges .
I advocated my viewpoints because I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Accordingly most advertisements would make the products seem much better than they really are .

There are thousands and thousands of products and services being promoted in advertisements .
However not all commodities and services are needed by the consumers , at least not all of them .
But advertisements will be presented in all media like newspaper , TV commercials , street signs as if it is for all mankind .
All the advantages of a product are being highlighted , whereas nothing will be mentioned about the weaknesses , which definitely would exist .

For example , insurance company 's selling piont is the efficiency and complete service whenever there is a claim after a car accident .
But in reality , there are always complicated paperwork to complete and a long process for the claim to be approved .
Sometimes a client has to go to different departments and doctors ' offices to get verification .

The promotion of a soft-drink will also emphasis how good it is to a thirsty person and meet needs for energy , etc. whereas how soon a person would get thirsty again and the side effect will not be mentioned at all .

Some commercials will do comparision between one product with another brand .
For instance , laundry powder that would clear stains of all kinds totally and quickly , whereas the type from another manufacturer will not do the same good job .
But they would not let the consumers know exactly how the experiments was conducted .

Many advertisements use famous people like sports figures , movie stars , singers , or young and attractive people to draw people 's attention .

As a matter of fact , I do agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because of the developement of technology , businessmen like to use technical ways to make their commercials look attractive to customers .
Why I agree with the statement is due to the following reasons .

First of all , in my opinion , businessmen realize if they want everyone to buy their products , they ought to have a good advertisement because human can be attracted by nice pictures .
For example , I like to eat instant noodles and one day there was a new flavor coming up and when I saw the commercial on TV , the noddle looked like very delicious .
However , after I bought one pack of that instant noodle , I tried it and I found it did not tast like the one I saw on TV .
I was upset about that .
Thus , making a good advertisement is a way that businessmen like to use to attract people .

Secondly , in term of busin , advertisements are considered as the best ways to sell products .
For example , my friend is running a carpet company and before he opened this company , he was asking me for setting up a website for his company .
Ultimately , I did a great job on the task that he assigned me .
When he saw the website , he told me it was incredible .
Moreover , because of this website , he got many customers .
However , in hindsight , the pictures that I put on the website look much better than they really are in that I use a very good camera .
Therefore , advertisements are the ways that businessmen use to sell products .

In conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because customers are attracted easily by those beautiful pictures .
Furthermore , good advertisements are also used by businessmen .
In the end I would like to summarize my argument by emphasizing that do not buy those products if you do not trust the advertisements .

Whether it be a commercial on television , a page in the magazine , or a billboard .
Make up , food , clothing , or any other product that seems appealing to people these days , are always advertised much better than they truly are .

It 's always exciting for women to see the gorgeous eyelashes in the magazines from a certain mascara .
It looks long and thick in the magazines , but once you buy it , it looks nothing like what you saw .
Being angry and throwing the mascara away wo n't help .
That 's just the way advertisements are .
They are made to attract people and made for people to buy what they are trying to advertise .
Or else , what 's the point ?
Why would an advertisement be about something to make people sick to the stomach ?
( Unless it was about not doing drugs and showing a picture of what it could do to you . )

I remember when I was in second grade and I was walking through a store and I came upon this barbie convertible .
The box had a picture with Barbie and Ken in it , and I thought wow how great !
A convertible with Ken AND Barbie in it for only 20 dollars ? !
However , when I got home and opened it , I realized that it was only the convertible .
Little did I know , the advertisement on the box had in tiny words `` Barbie and Ken not included . ''
Even if it has the words in tiny letters on the side , the advertisement is still tricking you and having your mind not even think twice about reading the box or paying attention and just buying it .
If the picture on the box only had a convertible , it would look dull and unappealing to most , and therefore they would n't earn any money .

The commercial industry always has to make a product look better than it really is .

Some advertisements intentionally give you the `` good points '' of a product while hiding the actual , sometimes more important , limitations or disadvantages of the product .
For example , some credit card company claims in its advertisements that its credit card service has 0 % APR ( annual payment to the service ) .
However , when customers subscribe to the service excitedly , they find that there are actually other fees with different names associated to the service , which are not mentioned at all in the advertisements .
In this way , the company successfully lead people to believe that their service is cheaper than others , while in fact it might be more expensive .

Another way to trick the people watching advertisements is to make invalid or incomplete comparisons with other companies ' products .
For example , some computer retailer compares his computers with the computers being sold by another retailer .
However , it only compares the features that his computers are better at , while ignoring other important features that might limit the performance of them compared to the other product .
However , people who watch this advertisement often have no expert knowledge of what features are important to computers , thus getting tricked to believe what the advertisements say .

Sometimes , advertisements even use deceptive means to attract customers .
For example , a clothes-selling store gives an advertisement that it will give a sale on Saturday .
It then lists several prices of certain clothes compared to their prices a few days ago .
However , the store actually increased the original price to make a bigger difference in the prices , which deceives customers .

There 're many more ways that advertisements exploit to make their products better than they really are .

"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisements are meant to convince potential buyers to purchase certain items .
Therefore , in order to convince the buyers , advertisements almost always make products appear better than they really are .
My reading of an article on the local newspaper and my personal experience of purchasing a skin care product prove this point to be true .

I once read an article on a local newspaper that informed readers about the art of advertisement .
The article said that in order to convince the potential buyers to purchase certain items , the advertising market must make the products to appear as amazing as possible , even if they appear better than they actually are .
So that potential buyers will be convinced of the products ' worth and effectiveness .
If the advertisements make the products seem worse or the way they really are , they will have a more difficult time to convince buyers .
In my opinion , the article had a point .

In addition to the article , my personal experience also proves that most advertisements make products seem better .
I have always wanted clear , smooth skin .
I remember seeing an advertisement of a skin care product on the television .
The product was described in the advertisement to be so effective that I was completely convinced before even trying it .
However , after purchasing the skin care product and using it for two months , I still had countless pimples on my face and the quality of my skin did not improve at all .
This experience showed me that advertisement make products much better than they really are .

Both the article on my local newspaper and my personal experience prove to me that most advertisements make products seem better than they actually are .
In numerous cases , the products that buyers purchase in reality do not live up to their descriptions in their advertisements .
So next time when I purchase an item , I will not judge its worth and effectiveness just by looking at its advertisement .

"When opening a magazine , the first page you will see is the advertisement .
And you keep reading the magazine , it is not difficult to more advertisement .
Some of these are very attractive , so you will buy the product finally because of the beautiful advertisement .
Is this product as good as the advertisement you see ?

Most media have advertisements to sell the products .
Generally , the capital of a product may be quite cheap .
However , when this product sell on the market , it becomes pretty expensive because of the expense of advertisements .
These money is not run into making product , and each of the capital is limited .
Therefore , people always pay more than the real value of the product since they are paying the advertisement 's fee .
Think about it , are these products which are advertised on the media are better than they really are ?

Most companies would use a lot of money to decorate their products and advertising becasue they want to catch the buyers ' attention .
That is why nowadays the products we see in advertisements are better than the real one .
Everyone loves things with nice apperance and the companies use this physology to earn people 's money .
People always buy things on impulse because they see the goods are neatly and cute on the advertisements .
After having brought these goods , they may realize that they make a wrong decision to buy such things .

We should be careful to the advertisements because we may fall into their trick anytime .
And we should be a critical thinker when we want to buy anything .

a stratege of promoting products
a way of attracting customers from existing market

As we are in the twenty-first century , we are facing more challenge in promoting our products to occupy the market than before , more especially the new products .
Therefore , manufacturers as well as retailers must find an efficient way to sell the products .
Advertisement is the very important way to introduct the products to the market .

There is a marketing department in every successful company to promote the products or services to existing customers as well as potential ones .
Take cell phone company as an example , in US , we have Verizon , T-mobile , Singular etc .
Thus , their advertisements are really play critical roles in attracting more customers .
So there are famous sentences such as : `` raising the bar '' , `` the best network follows you '' or `` get more minutes '' and so on .
Cellphones serve the function of our communication , so I think those advertisements do not describe the real functions of their products , in other words , it is a kind of exaggerating .

We have more products to compare and to choose in the limited market .
I still take cellphone as an example , we can not use more than one cellphone in our life .
We make our choice according to the advertisements of those cellphone companies or the recommendation of our friends .
I signed my contract with Verizon simply because they advertised their family plan .
As a matter of fact , the `` best network follows you '' sometimes did not work out in my situation .
In certain area or in the moving car , I experienced bad signal problem .

To sum up , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are in order to survive in the competitive society .
As a consumer , we should protect ourselves by purchasing rationally .

"I do agree with the viewpoint that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are .
In fact , the purpose of the advirtisement is to incite the desire of the customers and increase the sales of their products .
It is unavoidable to use some kind of communation skills to stimulate customers to buy their products .

In order to increase the sales of the products , advertisements will mask some kind of shortages of their products and only put emphasis on the outstanding points of the products .
For example , the renovation of the processors of the personal computers is fast .
Many processors manufactures always emphasize on the processing speed of their products .
However , they never mention some important features such as how much electricity will be used for using the chips and how hot they will produce during usage .
For a good computer , low temperature and stable performence are far more important rather than fast speed , however , the advertisements never expose their shortages .

Another example is the advertisements for restaurants .
They always show how good their foods are and how low cost for their foods .
However , the advertisements seldom give correct information to costemors that what kind of food is good for health and necessary for human body .
The purpose of the photos of the advertisement is to arise the interests of customers and the ultimate goal is to sell their products .
In addition , when we buy foods in malls or supermarkets , we can often discover that the pictures do not match with the products .
The photos of their products are surely more beautiful than they are in reality .

Good advertisements will deliver the correct information to the customers and help customers make reasonable decision .
On the other hand , inadquate advertisements will affect the brand images of the products and further damage customers .
In my opinion , more and more poor advertisements are showing throuth different media and thus it will be more difficult for customers to make right decision in the future .

Undoubtedly , nowadays , advertisements are everywhere , people could n't live without them .
There are on the TV , in the radio , on the top of the building , event being printed on the subways and buses .
Most of advertisements combine with words and illustations , these sentences and colorful pictures strongly draw people 's attention .
I Take myself as an example , I was always being attracted by the huge billbroad hung on the Time Square , and I felt these pictures are so delicate , elegant and beautiful .
Nevertheless , have you ever think about that are they too good to be true .
Are these modles on the billbroad really as perfect as princes and princesses in the child 's book .
I mean They have no pimples or extra hairs at all on their faces .
Something must be done for this advertisement I suspect .
After I went to graphic design school to obtain the knowledge about photoshop , I understood that actually these perfect faces had gone through special repairs , the advertisers or graphic designers applies photoshop to make the model 's faces look fawless .
In this way , advertisements will attract comsumers to purchase more products , and make more profits for merchants .
However , it brought about many disadvantages .
Some products in the advertisements look too good to be true , actually , in some extent , the companies or merchants misled the comsumers .
For instance , one day , I went to lunch at Wendy 's , I was attracted by an advertisement that a huge hambager with a big pack of french fries only charge me $ 3 .
Then I bought it without a hesitation .
When I recieved the food from the attentant , I was competely shocked .

From that day , I did n't trust food advertisement at all , I thouhght they are all fake , the food is not as food as they discribe

"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
It is originated from the nature of the advertisement , the celebrities influence and weasal words in ads .

The purpose of advertisement is to get you to buy the products .
Of course , advertiser will try their best to make the advertisements as appealing as possible .
How to acchive that goal ?
They will have to exaggerate the products , sometimes unintentionally .
For example , certain vacuum machine claims that it will never lose grib of dirt on TV .
We all know that it cannot be true simply because all machines can not always perform the best with aging .

Additonally , Commercials use celebritoes to add glamour to their products .
Everyday , we see Paris Hilton , Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears appearing on TV with perfect make-up and well-fit jeans .
We might imagine if we use that makeup that we will look just like them .
Obviously , it is not true .
Not everyone has such a good face and such a sexy body , but the commercials mislead us to dream of that , those advertisements make the products seem so much better than they really are .

Finally , there are full of weasal words to fansinate customers , such as `` better '' , `` younger '' , '' faster '' , `` more '' , When a toothpaste advertisement says '' we kill more oral germs than competitive brand does '' .
We have to ask `` how much more ? ''
One more ?
Two more ?
Or in fact no more at all ?
It can not be proved .
It alwalys easier to talk the talking .
Similarily , When a car says it can run faster , we have to know what the car is faster than .
A bike ?
A scooter ?

"Yes , I totally agree with this statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
It is a shame that being a consumer is getting harder because there are too many advertisements present their products in the most attractive ways .

I think the reason is that there are many companies and manufactures out there making the same type of products .
Therefore , they all have spend a great amount of money on advertising so they can compete with each other and survive .
And due to the advanced technologies those advertisement agencies use , almost every product they present looks like the best on the market .
But very often , consumers do n't really get what they expected after purchasing the product by just looking at their ads .

For example , few weeks ago I saw a digital camera ad on FRY 's Electronics that was offering a great discount on this featuring model .
It the picture , the camera got a great metalic texture and looked very well built .
Although I owned a professional digital SLR camera ( by CANON ) for a while , I wanted soemthing inexpensive , small , and easier to carry around in the campus .
I purchased the camera without doing some research online or trying it in the store .
When I took it home , I realized its body was not metal but some light ; cheap plastic .
The fully charged battery died with in just 30-40 minutes of photo shooting after trying it .
I finally got frustrated and decided to return it .

The return line was very long and the guy behind me was returning the same camera too due to the same reason .
We talked for more than 30 minutes while waiting and we reached a conclusion that never purchase something just based on the ad or picture .

From now on , I do studies online or read some consumer reviews before I purchase .
Even the old saying goes `` A picture worths more than a thouthand words '' , it does n't apply on all products we see on advertisements nowadays .

Advertisement itself is the way the company tell the people what they are making for them , the main propuse of making a advertisement is to convey people to buy their product .
It is the same as you are applying for college .
You do want the admission officer to see the advantages you have , and avoid the disadvantages as possible as you can .
By doing so , you are tring to perswade the admission officer to let you enter the college .
These is just as same as what companies doing to their coustmers by making advertisements .

Think about it , if there are two apples on the table , one is big and red while another is small and green , which one would you prefer by just looking at them ?
Of course the one that looks better !
When we are watching an advertisement , the product are often looks really good , or even better than they really are .
However , that not because the advertisement maker is cheating us , they just want us to feel better by the first looking at the product since we had never seen it before .
For example , when a professional photographor is taking pictures of a new product , say , wine , for a company , he may use the mixture of red ink and water instead of using the real wine .
Becasuse when he put the mixture under the light , it look more clear than wine and people would like these kind of things .

When people have a good first visual impress of the product , they would possiblely going to buy it , and before they really hold the product in their hands , it have nothing to do wheater the product is good or not .
Since then , advertisements have finished their job .

"Nowadays , people make their advertisements so good so people will purchase , try , or use their products .
However , are they really as good as they seem to be ?
I strongly agree with the statement most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In today 's world , most of the people will do anything for money , even when it comes to the place where they will have to cheat on those who are innocent .
Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the same reason as well -- they want people to buy their products .
We can see it everyday when we turn on the TV , commercials from fastfood restaurant , toy company , and even computer company .
One of the most representative advertisement is the one from McDonald .

I still remember the first time I saw the commercial of McDonald , they made their hamburger in the advertisement so big and juicy that it seemed to be the best hamburger in the whole wide world .
And after seeing the commercial , the first thing I thought was to go to McDonald and eat their juicy hamburger .
However , after I had arrived at the McDonald and ordered some of their best hamburgers , I realized that I had been cheated on .
The hamburger I had in my hands was not an enormus , tasty hamburger .
Oppositely , it was a tiny , dry burger with only a few pickles in it .
From the time on , I barely trusted any advertisements no matter how good they look .

The second and the last time I was cheated on was when the famous computer purchasing channel had this seller who completely fooled me by saying and showing simultaneously that how strong the computer he was selling is .
I was in the desire of needing a new computer , as a result , I called them without questioning and ordered the computer .
Soon , I regreted what I had done .
The computer I recieved did not work at all , I could n't even turn it on .
At first , I thought it was my problem , and thus , I called up my friend .
What shocked me was that my friend told me that the computer did n't even have a graphic card .

For the true stories above , I never trust any advertisements since then , I only believe in what I see , not what people say .

"Everytime , when we turn on TV or open megazines , there are always advertisements there .
In order to catch customer 's eyes , the sellers do spend a lot of money to make their products looking better and even to give customors the wrong impression .

First , the most common advertisements give people wrong impression is food advertisement .
For example , the Burger King 's hamburgers are always bigger on TV and smaller in the stores .
This is really disappointing thing when I decide to get a super big hamburger .
Moreover , we never see hamburger advertisements tell customers exact how big a burger is .
We never see a store says that we will see you a 5 x5x5 cm3 big hamburger .
Thus , we all come happily with a hope to get a super big burger , but leave disappointedly .

Second , the drug advertisements always try their best to delivery population a image of how fast and effect their medication , but lack of inforamtion regard to side effects .
A very good example is the great drug , Viagra .
When Viagra just came up the market , the drug company never mentioned that patients with coronary artery disease cannot take this medcation .
The consequence of not telling the fully information was to put people in danger .
Later , durg company added the addition information when it adversed Viagra .
However , the strong image of rescure men 's sex life is far greater than the image of dying from heart attack when patients with coronary artery disease take the comnication of Viagra and their cardiac medication .
Thus , drug advertisements always tend to lead the poluation to ignore the side effects .

"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
My argument is clearly supported by the following reasons and examples .
To illustrate the point , we first want to know the purpose of the advertisement .
Why are the manufacturers spending so much money on advertisements .
The anwer is quite simple to everybody .
They want to make money out of the products .
That determines that most advertisements exaggerate the advantages of the products , and rarely mentioned the downsides .
And the disadvantages are usully played down if they are mentioned at all .
For example , Toyota claims that the Prius , the most famous brand of hybrid cars , can run 42 miles per gallon of gas .
However , that 's not true , at least for most of situations .
The typical mileage of Prius is only around 35 , a quite gap from the Toyota 's claim .
In fact , you can get mileages close to 42 when you drive on the highway only .
Obviously , the advertisement put out by Toyota handily never mention that .

There is another example .
Proactive , the famed medication for treating acny , states in the advertiesment , that it works very well on different types of skins , no matter dry , sensitive , very moisture .
It turns out that it is not true either .
It only works fairly well on dry skill .
It does n't work on the sensitive skin at all .
In turn , it could make the situation worse .

The nature of an advertisement is essentially determined by its mission , marketing the product for its producer .
Thus I strongly believe that all advertisements are doing exaggerations , more or less .
Since almost all risks generated by using the products are on consumers , therefore , consumers should do their own researches when puchasing products , especially for higly valued goods or important products for health .

People do not spend much time on thinking whether advertisements will match what they advocate .
They tend to follow the trend that advertisements have created .
But from my experience , I find that most advertisements exaggerate the benfits of their products or hide their potential harms .

But why do advertisements try to show us things that are actually not that good ?
Obviously , profits from products drive them to do so .
Particulary products that are assumed to cure or remove a chronicle diseases can be more attrative to us than others .
Manufacturers make use of our desire to spend money on these products .
In addition , less work on administering and censorship of advertisement can easily lead to the appearance of false adverstisements .
It 's admitted that the language of advertisement is very difficult to control .
Sometims , a subtle tone can make advertisements much better in overpraising their products .
However , from my understanding , the most important reason for this fact is that new media , for example internet , enter into our society .
These new media always can find a way to escape our current laws and rules on advertisements .
They figure out their effective methods to target a special group of people .
For example , teenager can take predomiance of population that surf internet often .

To some extent , I agree with the author 's general assertion that some advertisements do have some positive effects on consumers ' impressions on products but only through advertising cannot necessarily make products seem much better .
However , the author unnecessarily extends this broad assertion to an irreversible extreme while overlooks some essential factors .
On balance , My points of contention involve the fundamental and deep analysis as discussed below .

On the one hand , I would like to admit that the author 's statement , although suffers from some obivous drawbacks , has some merits primarily in some special cases in which the implicit rationale behind it accords with common sense and our experiences in daily life .
Hence , it is partially correct .
In the first place , I want to point out that advertisements can have positive effects on consumers ' recognition of certain product .
Since clients tend to accept the fact that only firms producing superior products will advertise their products because only those firms can make ends meet or even profit greatly through advertising .
It is true that marketing a product through advertising means investing a lot of money and a firm cannot know in advance whether these advertisements will be useful to the success of a product .
Hence , advertising is a high-risk investment and only big firms are appealed to advertise their products .
For instance , Microsoft Co. or Coca Cola Co. often advertise their new products through all types of media .
This phenomenon makes consumers think that advertised products are good in quality , however , which is often not the case .

Further more , advertisements tend to overstate the quality of a product .
Some words used in advertisements will elaborate the attractiveness of a product and will be unwillingly to admit the defects of a product .
Consequently , consumers who watch advertisements will aptly think that the product described in the advertisement is very good in quality although in reality this product is not so good .

On the other hand , recognizing that a more applicable should incorporate different aspects of the issue as sufficient as possible , I have to point out that the author overlooks some compelling factors that may affect this issue .
In short , this statement is problematic in some ways .
For example , some products do have the same quality as presented in advertisements .

In conclusion , issue of whether advertisements make products seem much more superior than they really are is a complex one , requiring subjective judgment .
Consequently , there are no easy or certain answers .

"I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years compared to today. Several factors indicate that the number of cars on the roads is likely to increase rather than decrease.

Firstly, the global population is increasing, leading to a higher demand for personal transportation. As more people enter the middle class in developing countries, the desire for car ownership is also growing. This trend suggests that there will be a greater number of cars in use in the future.

Secondly, advancements in technology, such as electric and self-driving vehicles, are making cars more appealing and environmentally friendly. As governments worldwide push for more sustainable transportation options, the shift towards electric cars is expected to accelerate, further driving up the number of cars in use.

Moreover, urbanization is on the rise, with more people living in cities where public transportation may not always be convenient or reliable. This prompts individuals to opt for private vehicles, contributing to the overall increase in cars on the roads.

In conclusion, considering the growing global population, technological advancements, and urbanization trends, it is more likely that there will be an increase in the number of cars in use in twenty years rather than a decrease.",P5,CHI,high,1
"As I ponder the future of transportation, I find myself leaning towards the belief that in twenty years, there will indeed be fewer cars in use than there are today. This shift is likely to be driven by advancements in technology, changes in societal preferences, and a growing awareness of environmental concerns.

One key factor contributing to this trend is the rise of autonomous vehicles. With companies like Tesla and Google investing heavily in self-driving technology, it is easy to envision a future where shared autonomous vehicles dominate the roads. This shift towards shared mobility services may lead to a decrease in individual car ownership, as people opt for convenient and cost-effective alternatives.

Furthermore, the increasing focus on sustainability may also play a role in reducing the number of cars on the road. With the rise of electric vehicles and a growing awareness of the environmental impact of traditional gasoline-powered cars, more people may choose to embrace alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, cycling, or walking.

In conclusion, while it is impossible to predict the future with certainty, the signs point towards a decrease in the number of cars in use in the coming years. As technology continues to evolve and societal attitudes shift towards more sustainable practices, it is likely that we will see a decline in the reliance on personal vehicles for transportation.",P5,CHI,high,1
"In contemplating the future of transportation, the notion that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now compared to today is a compelling subject. While some may argue that advancements in technology, urban planning, and environmental consciousness will lead to a decline in car ownership, others believe that the convenience and autonomy afforded by personal vehicles will continue to drive their popularity. 

One could argue that the rise of ride-sharing services, autonomous vehicles, and improved public transportation systems might reduce the need for individual car ownership. With the push for sustainable practices and the increasing emphasis on reducing carbon footprints, could we see a shift towards shared mobility solutions and a decrease in personal vehicle usage? 

On the other hand, the intrinsic value of personal vehicles in terms of convenience and freedom of mobility cannot be overlooked. Will people be willing to give up the comfort of their own cars in favor of shared transportation options, especially in suburban and rural areas where public transportation might not be as efficient?

In conclusion, while the future of car usage is uncertain, it is essential to consider the complex interplay of technological advancements, societal trends, and individual preferences. Will the allure of personal vehicles withstand the test of time, or will we witness a paradigm shift towards more sustainable and collective transportation options? Only time will tell.",P5,CHI,high,1
"As we look towards the future, the question of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today is a complex one. Personally, I agree with this statement due to several reasons.

Firstly, the rapid advancement of technology is leading to the rise of alternative modes of transportation such as electric cars, autonomous vehicles, and improved public transportation systems. With the growing awareness of climate change and the need for sustainable practices, more individuals are opting for eco-friendly transportation options. This shift towards greener alternatives could result in a decrease in the number of traditional gasoline-powered cars on the roads.

Secondly, urbanization trends are promoting the development of smart cities that prioritize efficient public transportation, biking lanes, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. As cities become more congested, there is a growing emphasis on reducing traffic congestion and air pollution, which could lead to a decline in private car ownership.

Furthermore, the rise of ride-sharing services and the concept of mobility-as-a-service are changing the way people think about transportation. Instead of owning a car, individuals may prefer to rely on shared mobility solutions, which could potentially reduce the overall number of cars in use.

In conclusion, while it is impossible to predict the future with certainty, the current trends towards sustainability, technological advancements, and changing urban landscapes suggest that there may indeed be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today.

The global push for reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change is leading to the development of electric vehicles and other eco-friendly options. As these technologies become more accessible and affordable, the appeal of traditional gasoline-powered cars may diminish.

Moreover, urbanization trends are also playing a role in potentially reducing the need for personal cars. With more people living in densely populated cities, there is a growing emphasis on walkability, cycling infrastructure, and efficient public transport networks, making car ownership less essential.

In conclusion, while it is impossible to predict the future with certainty, the current trajectory of the automotive industry and societal trends suggest that there could indeed be fewer cars in use twenty years from now. The convergence of factors such as the rise of alternative transportation modes, sustainability concerns, and urbanization all point towards a potential decline in individual car ownership.",P5,CHI,high,1
"As a mater of fact , the issue of whether there will be fewer cars than there are today is a complex one , requiring subjective judgment .
Different people hold different views due to their distinct background .
Therefore , there are no easy or certain answers to the question and final answers would rely on my own experiencr and personality .

I do agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
In the following discussion , I would develop my poins of views and constitute aspects of details as sufficient as possible .

In the first place , the most important reason that I cannot ignore is that nowaday , people have realize that the cars will produce seriously air pollution and this situation has became a big issue around the world .
To illustrate , it is apparent that air pollution has rais the attention of the global citizens and the most effective way to solute this problem is to decrease cars in use .

In the second place , another reason for my statement is that the oil price would be more expensive twenty years than today .
The amount of the oil will decrease but the demand of the oil will remain the same even increase .
Therefore , there will be ferwer cars in use because only a very small portion of people who might be very rich can afford the price .

Last but not least , I believe that people will use MRT as their transportation in the future because MRT is not only convenient but also in a reasonable price that everyone can afford it .
Therefore , there will be no need to buy a car as transportation .

To sum up , the air pollution cause by cars and high price of oil made me agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .

"In the contemporary society , it seems certain that some people have formed a unrealistic picture on the problem concerning about the cars .
They considers that the car will be fewer in our future life .
They asset that along with the boom of the cars has come more serious probelms like air polution and enengy crisis .
However , from the informations I have collected in the past few years , nothing is further from the truth than it .
It 's no doubt that the car , one of the main transpotation in our society , will still play a dominent role in our future life .

First and foremost , the car stands for the development of a country .
The changes of the cars represent the changes of a country .
As is well known , China is a develpping country .
You could see few cars with few brands on the street in the last twenty years .
However , with the enhancement of our comperhensive nation power , many family has their own cars .
The number of cars are increasing as a eye-dazzling rate in our country .
We could easily conclude that there will be more car in each of our cities with the development of our country .

In the second place , the car will take place the pubilc transportation in the future .
Blessed with the convenience and high efficiency , the car could meet people higher demand in their daily life .
For instance , not only could people drive their own cars to work in each business day , but also they could arrange their vacation schedule by driving their car .
It 's no need for them to spend their timetable on pubilc transportation .

Last but not the least , variety cars will be made in this high technology society , such as the energy-saving cars , sunpower engning cars , to name just a few , which make it possible for people to save remnant energy and avoid the air pollution .

From what has been presented previously , we could safely draw a chonclusion that car will take beneficial moreeffects into our living standard , to our country , even to the society .
We should hold a positive attitude towards car which allow it bring its initiative into full play .

"Do you think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
People hold different views on this issue .
Actually , this topic is so complex and controvesial that it deserves careful consideration .
In my opinion , I think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To begin with , the first reson to illustrate my point is that people will take public transportation system more often than today .
Rather than driving cars by themselves , people would take bus or Mass Rapid Transit System to their destination for it is more convenient .
Take my home city Taipei for example .
Instead of being caught in the traffic jam during rush hours , people in Taipei prefer taking Mass Rapid Transit System to commute .
I think this will be a trend in the future .

In addition , the further aregument to strenghten my position is that not using cars is an effective and efficient way to save energy and reducing pollution .
For fear of depleting the prcious energy in the globe , it is wiser to do our best to save energy .
Moreover , to maintain a good and suitable environment , reducing both air and noise pollution by not using cars is a good method .
Since environment conservation is an important issue nowadays , I think not using cars is quite important .

Finally , another reason to reinforce my view is that taking public transportation system is much more economical than driving cars , Actually , maintaining a car is quite expensive .
Besides the expense of purchasing a car , it costs a lot to maintain and repair it .
Moreover , you have to spend a lot of time as well as money for parking your car .
On the countrary , taking public transportation system is quite smart .
Therefore , I believe more and more people will choose taking public transportation system in the future .

In conclusion , for the reasons mentioned above , I firmly believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

"Cars are playing a domintant role in human society .
Cars benefits people a lot ; they make us travel faster than by bicycle ; they make it convenient for people to travel to a concert .
However , cars also do harms to our daily life ; One of the most fatal harms cars make is the air pollution .
There has been a debate that whether people will give up using cars in future years .
As far as I am comcerned , cars will definitely be supplanted by other forms of transportation because of their disadvantages , though ther have oe or two advantages .
There 're several reasons why the number of cars will decrease .

Although cars have minor advantages to society , the numerous bad effects will make them dissapear after several years .
A car can produce at least three tons of carbon dioxide , which lead to the serious green-house effect , and several tons of nitrogen dioxide , which result from a black smoke around the sky .
with the number of cars growing in the past years , the air pollution made by car is increasingly serious these days .
The laws of forbiding the use of cars have even be made in some country such as Indoesia and China .
As a result , the number of the cars will definitely decline after a few years .

Another reason for the declining of cars is the limited road conditions .
The more cars in the road , the slower they move .
Even in some areas , people riding bicycle are much faster than people driving cars .
In singapore for example , the streets are full of automobiles .
It 's quite difficult for one car to move a foot .
If people see that there are a myriad of cars standing in the street , then how could they buy cars any more in thefuture ?

Though cars do benefits in some minor ways , and there should be a period of time to see the declining number of automobiles before the entirely disappearing of cars , the total number of cars will be fewer in the past twenty years .

"I do agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today despite the rapid increase of car consumption .
My reasons to believe so are stated below .

First of all , more and more people are willing to take mass transportation to go to work nowadays than a few years ago .
Because the traffic jam is more and more serious , people living in the cities prefer to take buses and subways to go to work to avoid such heavy traffic jams .
With the scarce of resource this problem might not be solved in years .
What 's more , to ride in mass transportation saves people valuable time to do other productive things .
Beside riding on mass transportation give city people more time to relax and think for their lives on their way home and to work .

Secondly , governments all over the world are becoming more aware of the pollution cars bring .
Some governments even set up rules to ban certain cars to run in the cities during paticular times .
Such rules forbiding the use of certain cars will continue to effect in the long run .
This will help to reduce the use of cars gradually .

Thirdly , people today are more concerned with their own health than ever .
Some may even walk to work or ride a bike to work instead of driving a car .
On weekend , more people go biking instead of go driving to rural resorts to relax .
Taking the popular biking clubs for example , they are developing quite rapidly to support the idea a lot of people are holding today that it 's better to travel along with physical exercises .
These kind of change helps me to belief that there will be fewer cars in the future .

In spite of all the above , the rapidly developed mass tranportation system and the widely accepted concept that health is most important in one 's life both add up to my belief that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To sum up , with the widely spreading concept of maintaining good health , the utility of advanced mass transportation and the help of the govenment , there will be fewer cars in 20 years use than there are today .

"I have once read a book talking about different stressful situations people would encounter in their lives and some solutions to these tough problems .
One of the unfavorable issues highlighted in the book is how to deal with a heavy traffic jam .
Undoubtedly , those traffic problems , no matter in which part of the world , has been remaining as a big headache for an extremely long period of time .
It seems the governments have tried every possible way to figure it out .
Thus , here is our concerns : are these policies and strategies being put into effect ?
In other words , are we going to see fewer cars on the road in , say , twenty years ?
From my point of view , I assume the dream would become true one day in future , though , I 'm not good at forecasting things ahead .

Firstly , it is now strongly advocated by policy makers to take public transportation system rather than driving private cars when traveling outside .
As a matter of fact , this plan is working well steadily .
People gradually have noticed that it is more convenient to take buses or subway to go to work and school than to drive private cars .
Take the subway as a striking example , if you take it to go to work during the rush hour in the morning , you wo n't be faced with traffic problems at all .
You do n't have to wait in an endless line and see no hope of moving your cars , in this sense , you can totally guarantee your arriving time at office and have nothing to worry about in terms of being late .
I believe there is nobody who would like to be blamed by his boss every day merely for not being on time .
Consequently , I found no reason for people to ignore the positive alternatives and still stick to his traditional and impractical ways .
In this case , there will be fewer and fewer people who purchase cars , or at least drive their cars during rush hours on weekdays .

Furthermore , the price of gasoline is increasing rapidly in recent time , which causes more and more people to complain that they barely could afford the cost .
Thus , in light of being more economical , the majority of people would not incline to buy more cars .
",P5,CHI,high,0
"I do n't agree with the statement .
I think in twenty year there will be more cars than today .
My opinion is based on the following reasons .

First , the cars are the most individual transportation tools .
They give people the freedom to choose when to leave and where to go and can make the journey more convinient .
As the society develops , pressure will increase and we are more and more likely to search for the freedom in our lives .
Cars are a good choice .
Although more cars will result in traffic jams in cities , people are building the cross bridges to solve the problem .

Second , many people may argue that the waste gas from the cars are one of the major reasons that pollute air .
However , scientists now have developed many kinds of cars that use clean energy such as the energy from the sun and so on .
These kinds of cars are in use in some countries by some people .
Moreover , scientists and manufacturers are trying their best to put these new cars into markets , aiming that these cars will be affordable for the public .
At the same time , scientists are also doing great effort to improve the speed of the these new cars .
And I believe in a near future , these new cars using clean energy source , will be as fast as the cars nowadays .
Also , I think the clean energy will also be used in the cars today , which will greatly decrease the pollution made now .
As a result , the major obstacle that prevent car using will be removed .

Third , as the economy of the world develops , the price of cars will go down , as well as the new cars .
Meanwhile the ability of people to buy cars will increase .
More people in the developed countries will own cars .
Each family or person will own more cars .
Further , more people in the developing or less developed countries will buy cars .
For example , in China only a few people have cars , and as the ability of consumption advances , more and more people are planning to buy cars .
And I think in the near future , there will more cars than now will be seen in the roads of China .

In conclusion , I think the number of the cars will increase , because cars can give every one a feeling of freedom , and as many problems caused by cars can be solved and the more and more people are able to afford a car , we are willing to buy this kind of freedom of our lives .

"Car was among the most significant inventions in the 20th century .
it has greatly improved transportation and brought tremendous convenience to our lives .
However , today , some people start to believe that car usage is going to decline in the near future .
Nonsensical ?
Not really .
I do agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
I will now explain my points .

First , twenty years later , it is very likely that other means of transpotation , such as aeroplanes and trains , will take over cars .
Today , travelling by air is already getting cheaper and faster .
With all the budget airlines emerging and the major air companies expanding their routs , air transportation system is going to get more established and more convenient .
The same is happening to train transporation sector .
Therefore , when this phenomenon continues to take place , cars will soon lose their popularity , especially when coupled with the next problem .

Most people may also stop driving as the cost of driving continue to increase .
By cost of driving , I am chiefly refering to the cost of petrol .
Petrol price is constantly on its rise today .
Twenty years later , petrol price may become so high that many people may not be able to afford using a car .
Hence , with many substitutes available , such as air-traveling and train-traveling , it is logical to expect a decline in car usage twenty years down the road .

Last but not least , people are getting more and more environmentally conscious today .
This consciousness is expected to discourage car usage in the future , so as to reduce air and noise pollution that most big cities are experiencing now .
People may switch to public transports for travelling within the city .
Some people may even choose to cycle instead of driving .
In other words , as people get more educated and concern about the environment more , one can expect the see less cars in the future .

In essence , cars may once be the favorite of Man in terms of traveling , but reality shows that this may not be the case soon .

"I would not agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I believe the cars increase rate will be reduced , however , there will be more cars in twenty years time .

First , cars have become a necessity in today 's world .
Society is growing at a super fast speed , and a high efficienty is needed for people to maintain the modern tight life style .
We have to admit that cars , as the fastest land transportation means , save us a lot of time in our daily life .
People do not want to use too much time to stay on the road , which is considered as a waste of life .
Also , the modern city tends to be larger and larger in size , and there is usuarally huge distance between people 's home and their work places .
This situation also brings the necessity of the usage of cars .
Let us take Beijing for example .
Beijing is much larger than 10 years ago , and many people would like to buy houses in the rural places where the housing price is lower , while they have to work in the central city .
Can you imagine what it woud be like if these people do not have cars ?
They will spend half of the day on the roads , or even more .
And in the near future , i cannot see any possibilities that cars number will be reduced .

However , we cannot ignore what harms the huge number of cars have brought to our environment .
The green house effect has made the climate warmer and warmer .
The scientists pointed out that , if the temperature keeps growing at such a speed , our continents will be flooded one day , and by then , we would have no places to live .
The atmosphere is no longer as clean as before due to the huge amount of wasted gas that cars have produced .
It is causing a slow negative effect on humanbeing 's health .
Public awareness should be raised to limit the number of cars , and actually many countries have taken measures already .
In singapore , the government limits the number of cars by charging a high tax rate , and fewer and fewer people can afford cars .
Taking this issue into consideration , I strongly believe that the number of cars will not be increasing as fast as now , in twenty years time .

In conclusion , we can not omit cars , because they are playing so important a role in our daily life .
However , we have to learn how to use cars properly , without destroying the environment we are living in .
I think more and more people will be aware of this fact , and in twenty years time , the car will not increase as fast as today .

Nowadays , cars are one of the greatest inventions in the 20 century .
It makes us east to get anywhere .
Also , it improves our country development .
However , there are many advantages about using the cars , I do agree this statement for the follwing reasons .

First of all , with the development of technology , we have many advanced and new transportations to assist us to get any places .
Such as trains , airplanes , even many mass transportations are faster and even more convenient than cars .
And for people , advanced transportation can save much time to do other things .
Therefore , I think that they can replcae cars in the future .

In addition , there are few resources such as oil and gas in the earth .
In the past , humans used the said resources without futher consideration .
They even believed that not only the earth would provide more and more oil and gas and but also they can utlize what they needed .
So , if we can not find the alternatives to solve this problem , there will be fewer cars in use in decades undoubtedly .

The most important reason is that car using leads to many pollrtions .

Although some people hold the opinion that there will be more cars in twenty years because of the develop of the ecnomy , some people believe that the car numbers will become fewer .
Personally , I am one of those believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
My view will be greatly sustantiated by the following discussions .

The most persuasive point is that the science tecnologies are rapidly developping now .
That means there will be some other veicles subsititue cars .
According to some available surveys , it is said that over 60 percentages companies which are faminiar for their car producing are engaging in inventing new veicles .
For example , the Toyota company in Japan has invest over 7 billions to invent new veecles , and some new productions were showed in the presentations during the past few years .

Furthermore , the resouces in our planet are not allow too much cars which comsume a great mount of energy to run in our society .
accompaning with the development of the groble ecnomic , more and more countries especially China consum a lot fuels .
Not only do the gas has been greatly reduced but also other resurces .
It is commonly believed that cars pay an important role in the reductions .
If the number of cars are more that that of today , what other resouces will be provided to cars .

In addition , the environments in the world areworsen now .
There is a strong lik between an increasing the car numbers and the worsen pollution in our world .
You imagine what it will be when almost every people drive themselves to work .
Recently , the stradegy of sustainable development has been widely spreaded , Many measures relate to the policy will help the world to get fewer cars .

Taking into account all these factors which sometimes correatle together to generate an integrate whole and thus become more coving than any single one of them , we may safely draw the conclusion that the car numbers will be reduced in twenty years , that means there will be fewer cars than that of today .

"Will we have more cars in the future or not ?
This is a questions that many people would like to find out whether they are car producers , environmentalists , or just regular people who either taking public transportation or owning a car .
However , I think it is important to address that different parts of the world might have different results .
It is because people in different places give different cultural meanigns of the cars and they might have different priority in relation to what is imporatnt to them as a group .
I will start by pointing out how different places preceive cars in some ways and how these differences might increase or decrease cars in the future .

First , in some developing countries , such as China , car is a symbol of modernity and wealth .
When this connection is formed and built , it is quite difficult to expect that poeple will decrease cars in use within twenty 20 years since what people desire is development .
And , this image of developement happend to also means `` having cars . ''
In this sense , I think it is quite unrealisitic to agree that people will diminish the amount fo cars .
After all , the major goal of these places is economic development and decreasing the ownership of cars contracdicts to their major goal .

On the other hand , for some places in the world , especially countries in the West , the meaning of cars and the prority of what is imporant to them are different .
To them , car is more or less merely a tool .
Although I do realize that some people in the West aslo use car as a symbol of prestige , there is a degree difference in relation to how stronger that a car is tied with the concept of modernity .
Meanwhile , peopel in teh West might think the envirnment protection is at least as important as development , if it is not more important .
In this sense , when cars do not carry such strong desire of being modern , meanwhile the idea of environmentialism is appreciated , it is more likely that there will be less cars in the nearly future .

Therefore , I think teh amount of cars will decrase in some areas in the world meanwhile decrease in other areas depends on different context and the symbolic meanings of cars in different cultures .
I think it is problematic to make a universal statment on this issues .

"With the swift and tremendous development of industry , people are making every effort to enjoy life .
In the mean time , the industrial growth also brings huge damages to human living conditions .
The air pollution produced by over use of vehicles is a warn that people should cut down on the application of them , which leads me to believe that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To begin with , the abuse of cars has caused severe environmental issues .
Many people have been in possession of cars for quite a long time .
They travel by car , go to work in a car , and even discuss commercial transactions in the moving status since it is an efficient way to promote the dealings .
However , it is commonly realized that gasoline consumption may lead to undoubtedly serious environmental problems including but not limited to air pollution and infectious diseases concerning lung functions .
The gas emitted by the engine is a detriment to human living surroudings , which can damage human lungs , limiting the function of breathing to carry adequate oxygen to every part of huamn bodies .
On the other hand , such emitted gas can drift in the air for a long time possibly becoming the excellent medium for the growth of bacteria .

Furthermore , nowadays , more and more people are wary of the problems caused by cars .
People , aiming at sustainable development , are undergoing a lot of measures to control the damages .
Scientists are conducting experiments to evaluate the results of car produced gas .
Service workers are promulgating the latest or maybe recent findings of them to guide people in a correct direction -- decrease the use of cars .

People can also enhance their health by other alternatives of cars .
They may practise their strength and endurabililty by riding or running in stead of driving .
In this way , people force themselves to use their own muscles and energies which is a both economic and effective way to improve their health and weight loss , a popular issue , may also be realized .

In a word , in my view , use of cars will become less and less in 20 years in that it results in rigid environmental damages , and people may become healthier by abandoning cars despite that cars without gasoline consumption may be produced out in a mass since the use of cars may increase human weight , causing a lot of problem relating to blood pressure and heart functions .

"I do not agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
First of all , car industry is now developing very fast in the developing countries such as China and India .
These countries have large numbers of population .
Large population means big potential of car comsuming .
People living in these countries are becoming richer and richer .
Therefore , more and more people in these countries are able to buy a car .
In the future 20 years , the number of these group of people will grow bigger so there would be more cars in developing countries in twnety years .

Secondly , in developed countries , most of the families have their own cars .
Cars play a very important part in people 's livies .
People will feel very unconvenient if they do not have a car .

Cars have influence people 's livies so significant that it is impossible to change the situation in twenty years .

Thirdly , the style of cars may change a lot in the future .

"When we are in a highly industrilized booming society , how can we imagine the future ?
Will the quantity of cars be fewer in use in twenty years than there are today ?
I think the answer is an absolutely no for all the merits of them .

Cars are one of the most practical and useful inventions through the last centruries .
As the high technology soars up , cars also has been greatly modified for the benefit of people .
We can get a scenic spot far more quickly than before with cars which have save much time for us to rest or to stay in the right spot in the duration of our travelling .
We can enjoy the beautiful scenes we meet on our way , pull aside the car whenever and wherever you want .
This is impossible when you are on a train .

Cars make us feel more friendship between our friends and us .
We can call in on our friends who live far from us whenever we want .
We do not have to schedule our visit plans and be bothered by the unappropriate timetable of buses and trains .
When a friend is in trouble , we can drive a car immediately and help him .
Reversely , our friends will do all the favor for us with a car in hand .

Another merit is driving a car make us feel more self-satisfactory .
When you charge a car which you buy it with your salary and bring your whole family , how happy and self-accomplished you feel !
This can not be denied .

Admittedly , people will say that they bring us polluted air and unhealty , what 's more , some lung and cardiovascular diseases .
The traffic jams seem never stop .
The fossil fuel makes people feel disgust .
As to these , I 'd say that it is not car 's fault .
Cars do not originally be made to harm people .
They are beneficial machines .
Technology often brings good and bad , whether it is a curse or a blessing , depends on how to control and modify it , and just the technology itself can solve the problems .
So do cars .

We have to take out more measures than before as the increasing population which will really be possible that more people will charge a car .
More roads will be estabilished whatever are under the original roads or above .
More traffic administration should be put in force .

"The number of cars people own is always cited in papers or articles when judging a nations economic and transportation development .
From some scholars and economists ' perspective , the more a society possesses , the better-off its citizens are .
This is why some people predicts that there will be much more cars in use in twenty years than there are today because the global economy is booming prosperously .
However , as far as I am concerned , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The reasons are as follows : For the first thing , as people are concentrating on economic development in differnt societies , almost everyone in the world are paying more and more attention to protecting the environment .
Cars , which consume fuels and give off a lot of waste air , are then objected by a large number of environmentalists .
The development in China is a typical example .
Twenty years ago , heavy industries and factories mushroomed with no regard of what harm they might do to the environment .
After experienced a serie of frustrations of the polluted water , contaminated ground and deforested plants , today Chinese people have come to know how to combine economic development and environment protection .
As a result , people are encouraged to use cars as little as possible .

For the second thing , fuel in the whole world is in short .
It is reported just two days ago in CCTV news that the price of fuel in Chinese market has risen again because of the lack of fuel all around the world .
As the natural resources are so limited , we have to consider what we can leave to our offsrings if we keep consuming them at such a high degree .
So , if we limited the number of cars in use , we can make significant contribution to reserving the natural resources .

Admittedly , to limited the number of cars in use may cause some inconvenience to some people .
For example , those who working far from home everyday may feel worried .
In order to solve this problem , I recommend that the government take measure to develop transport vehicles that do not consume fuel and thus do no harm to the environment such as undergrounds .
For other peoples who do n't have to go very far to work everyday , they can go by bicycle .

In conclusion , as the natural resources are limted and as the environment needs to be procted by everyone , we should use cars less .

However , I believe that there will not be significantly fewer cars in use twenty years from now on .
Firstly , with the rise of many third world countries such as China and India , many more individuals will be able to replace their cheaper vehecles , such as bicycles and motorcycles , with cars .
Not only because of the luxury , they will be able to travel to further places more frequently .
Economic advancements also encourage researches on greener energy .
In the future , cars with inbuilt solar panels may become the major vehicles on the road .
Besides using solar energy , a greener way of travelling can also be achieved with reduction in car sizes .
There may be options varying from one seat personal cars to six seats family mini vans .
The lack of metals for car manufacturing can also be solved with technology .
Researches on strong materials such as carbon nanotubes may serve to replace today 's steel sheets .

Cars , just as many other items we have in modern lifestyle , provides us with tremendous convenience .
Yet , they bring about problems that may one day lower our quality of life .
However , instead of escaping , we should confront the problems with better solutions .
Hence , there will be more cars instead of fewer , just greener and smaller , twenty years later .

"Were there be more cars in the future comparing to the number of cars used today ?
In today 's world , cars were used everywhere for the efficiency of transportation for people .
They were the necessities of people in this century , and they served as an important tool used today .
In my opinion , I disagreed that number of cars would decrease in twenty years .
In contrast , I believe that the number of cars would increase in the near future .

First , as what I 've mentioned previously , cars were an important usage for the people today .
They made people easier to travel around their country , and they encouraged vacations outside their city .
As people noticed the importance of cars everyday , they would as well encouraged them to buy a car for the sake of their own .
As population increased , more teenagers would dream of having a car .
As more and more people joined this world , more cars would be bought by consumers .
WIth the growth of technology , consumers would have to buy more cars in order to maintain themselves in the world of modern technology .

Second , as more and more people in this world earned more money , they would have the desire to buy more cars rather than one .
Cars were made very attractive these years , and more people were attracted to the beauty and the eloquence of the newly designed cars .
With the amount of fortune they have , they would be easily convinced to buy another car to fulfill their desire .
Owning two or three cars in the garage , people would be able to raise their social standards , and cope with the advancement of modern technologies .

Last but not least , families that consisted of more than six members would have the intention of buying more cars .
One car in this kind of family was definitely not enough .
As the family grew , they would want to change their cars into bigger ones that could fit the entire family .
Furthermore , the family would have to buy extra cars to meet different reasons .
For example , one car could be used to drive children to school , while the other bigger car for family vacation .
Moreover , cars were the only way that families could travel together at a lower price .
Driving a car would only cost you fuel prices , but other transportations such as long distance buses and airplanes would cause you more .

Although many people would forfeit old cars and buy new ones to balance the number , the number of cars would simply increase as more families came to existence in this world .
Cars would grew their importance in this society , and people would begin to recognize their values .
With the help of these cars , people could enjoy themselves more in an advanced society , and more time would be saved .

"When an image of future world comes to mind , do you think that future cars are going to fly in the sky instead of driving on the ground ?
As far as I am concerned , there will be fewer cars than those of people imagine that will appear in the sky due to the following reasons .

First of all , there will be fewer cars in the future because the possible depletion of oil has alarmed people to explore other resources to replace mobiles that consume a great deal of oil each day .
Since the crisis of exhausting oil is around the corner , people nowadays are more eager to look for other resources that can replace the oil-consuming vehicles , or people just use oil-free transportation to achieve the goal of saving energy , like bycicling to work .
Due to the fact that everybody has a concern about energy shortage , people will gradually decrease the amount they drive right now and the cars they produce and buy in the future .

Secondly , to solve the problem of oil shortage , governments will put more emphasis on the development of public transportation .
For example , Taipei , the city where I grew up , has become more convenient due to its public transportation , the MRT transportation system .
Since the MRT can easily take people to to any corner of Taipei city with less time , why should people spend time whining in cars during traffic jams or zigzaging on roads ?
Hence , i believe that people will less motivated in the future to drive or even to buy a car .

To summarize , a highly well-developed public transportation will be every government 's first choice to explore in the future .
If all can well utilize the public transportation , our descendents will no longer to brook the pollution caused by cars .

"This is a controvertial topic about whether the number of cars will reduce in twenty years .
As far as I am concerned , there will be fewer cars .
My reasons are listed as follows .

First , we should take a glance at the opposite opinions .
Some people will deem that with the rapid economic growth ( especially in China ) , people will continue to buy their own cars because it is a convenience to their lives , they do not need to wait a long time and get into a crowded bus , which is commonly seen in China .

However , these people seem to ignore several essential aspects that would lead to the reduce of the numbers of cars .
The important reason is that people 's awareness of protecting the environment is gradually increased .
We all recognize the fact thatour environment is facing serious problems caused by human pollution , like global warming and water pollution , air pollutions .
And the government as well as the increasing number of people are taking effort to protect the environment .
They can give up using of plastic bags , so they can also give up buying their own car .

The equally important reason is that the oil price skyrockted in the last year and the prices are going to increase in the future .
It is just too expensive to afford a car to the majority of people because they have to use a lot of money to support their family , to pay for the education fees of their children , and to pay for the medical services .
They will choose to use public transportations due to the higher and higher oil price .

Moreover , the government is taking great effort to build public transportations .
They use a large number of money on developing more rail road , more buses to every corner of the contry .
and also metros have been built to easing the heavy traffic in more and more big cities .

Taking into account of all the aspects mentioned above , I am firmly convinced with the opinion that the number of cars will reduce in twenty years .
",P5,CHI,high,0
"In twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use and the following will illustrate why .

Maybe you will find this saying quite odd as nowadays automobiles are found everything , especially in city like Hong Kong .
However , due to the decrease population rate and the increase elderly and death rate , such scenario can be easily understood .
With the low birth rate and the high death rate , in twenty years time , it is believed that the world 's population will be decreased by forty percent .
Wiith such low population , the demand for automobiles will definitely decrease and hence by that time , fewer cars will be found .

Pollutants caused by cars are another example that will support such saying .
According to a research , it is estimated that pollutant and other toxic gases exhausted from the cars are three times as harmful as breathing in smog directly .
In order to control the problem of air pollution , many countries will eventually impose heavy taxes on cars , or to certain extent , ban the use of car .
Hence , in twenty years , fewer cars will be in use .

The rise of oil prices and other economic factors are also the reasons for the reduce in the use of cars in twenty years times .
As you may observe , the oil prices have been fluctuating rapidly , together with the adverse economic factors such as high unemployment rate , many car users will find it relatively expensive and risky in using cars , causing the decrease in number of cars in uses in the long run .

Last but not least , improvement in technology will also reduce the number of cars in use .
We all know that cars can narrow the distance bepeople and improve communications , increasing the interactions between people so as to make a better society .
However , with the improvement in technology , such means are n't essential .
For example , with the rise of the Internet , we can commmunicate easily and need not to drive our cars to see each other .
Besides , with the improvement in technology , maybe within twenty years time , inventions such as travelling machine will be invented , making cars being redundant .
All these can explain why there will be fewer cars in twenty years .

"Today , the world has grow on a rapid pace with fast development and high technology .
Through the innovatives of scientists and engineers , cars become part of our everyday life .
In my opinion , the numbers of cars would increase instead of decreasing in twenty years ' time because cars are convenient , traffic systems are improving and lack of alternatives .

On average , each house has at least two cars in my neighbourhood .
This example applies to most of the urban and sub-urban cities around the world too .
I strongly think that cars are the most convenient and easy means of travelling on roads .
Compared to motorcycle or bicylce , it is less dangerous and it could accommodate more passengers .
These qualities are equally important to the people in future whether the distance between one place to the other is short or long .
Consequently , the number of cars would easily increase .

Besides , cars are undeniably the most important vehicle in the world when it comes to travelling on road .
As countries all around the world racing to develop their traffic systems , it is proven that cars serve as the best travelling medium .
With the government working on ways to reduce traffic problems and improving the condition of roads to facilitate more cars , it is believed that the usage of cars are highly encouraged .
Therefore , more people would remain or resort to cars as their main vehicle when it comes to travelling .

In addition , there is no adequate alternatives to substitute the usage of cars .
Due the convenience and easy-accessible of cars , many would resort to cars instead of other forms of transportation .
For example , the train .
Although it is an environmental friendly type of public transport , the construction of the stations and railways would costs the government an exorbitant amount of money .
It is rather impossible to connect the whole country with train services .
Thus , cars are still the main option for the people in twenty year 's time .

Despite the forever increasing price of gas or petrol , and also the number of road accidents , in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use .
With the cooperation between the government and the people , those minor factors could be resolve while the people could enjoy fully the benefits of using cars .

"I agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
Certainly , there are many reasons to discourage people from using and owning cars .
The first reason is pollution .
Cars burn fossil fuels which give out lots of greenhouse gases and other pollutants .
As people become more aware of the environment , more and more people are against the idea of using cars now and in the future .

The second reason discouaging the usage of cars is the depletion of resources .
The number of years we will be running out of petroleum is calculated and it is shortened again and again due to rising demand .
The price of oil skyrockets in recent years , and so does the price of gasoline .
SUVs are no longer favoured by the consumers and more and more people gave up driving their cars totally or reduce their usage of cars due to higher oil price .

As the number of cars on road increases steadily , road conjestion and parking space have become serious problems in many countries , especially in fast developing countries like China and India .
It is quite normal for a driver in Shanghai to take two hours to complete a twenty minutes drive in conjestion .
Finding a vacant parking place can take up to half an hour in the central part of Shanghai .
Unsurprisingly that many drivers get frustrated and give up private driving .

However , solutions to the problems of the current cars have been implemented and some of them are working .
Hybrid cars invented by Toyota are selling fast , because the hybrid car saves energy and use less gasoline .
But the problem of depletion of oil is not directly addressed here as the electricity needed to charge the hybrid cars is generated mainly using oil .
Oil price will still increase and discourage people to drive cars .

"Some people hold the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today while others believe it in an opposit way .
As far as I 'm concerned that I am standing for it ..

As a matter of fact , with the rapid development of the countries from all over the world , cars indeed play an extremely important role in developing a country 's economy .
However , a better understanding of the pollutions caused by the cars will be enable us to live a better life .
Therefore more and more people have come to recognize the wisdom of not driving the cars .
Instead of that , taking public transportations are valued far more than driving their own cars when they are out by some people , because it not only has brought a large number of profits and convenience to the people 's life but also leaded to less pollutions , As a result people 's life become easier and healthier .
So the attempt by the government to limit the number of cars has been very successful , after all more and more people will give consideration to the public transportation when going ouside .

In addition to that , the importance of the bikes can never be overestimated. , for it is portable and small , that is to say you can take it to anywhere if you want. , therefore more and more people are more willing to ride bikes but to drive cars while they are out .
Apart from that , the bikes wo n't cause so much traffic jam , which will make people waste a large amount of time when they are on their way to work .
Above all , the bikes are regarded as the environmently - friendly tool , which enables people to live in a clean and comfortable conditions .
So to some extent , how wildly the bikes are uesd is a strong determinent of how the environment can be protected .
And an analysis of the meaningful events in history confirms the fact that , in order to save the plannet we live on , we will make good use of the bikes instead of the cars .
Therefore , in the future there will fewer and fewer cars in use It can ce concluded from the above than I agree with this statement .

"The industry of cars has developed rapidly in recent years in China .
The percentage of families which owns at least one car is growing fast .
There 's an opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
However , the development of cars will not end and the number of cars will not decrease in the future .

First , traveling by car is a convenient and necessary way of transportation in our daily lives .
We need cars all the time , when we go to school or work in the morning , when we return home in the evening , when we go on a trip to the grassland or the mountains , even when we go to a supermarket for shopping .
Cars are used so wildly and often that we can not imagine a kind of life in which there are no cars or fewer cars .

Second , though there are some problems traveling by car , they can be solved in the future .
Cars can pollute the air , but researches to reduce the pollution of cars are on the progress .
There are already cars using electric power which do not harm the environment .
For another example , the roads may be too crowded for cars to go fast , but newly-built highways and freeways are solving the problem .

Third , if we use fewer cars in twenty years , which mean of transportation should we use ?
by airplane , by helicopter , by subway , by bike , or just on foot ?
In the modern society , the speed required for transportation is faster and faster .
Therefore , traveling by bike or on foot is too slow .
Traveling by subway seems fast and convenient , but what about people living far from subway stations ?
Finally , airplanes and helicopters are too expensive for common people and too dangerous .

In conclusion , although cars have some disadvantages , the necessity of using them is still strong .
More convenient types of cars will be developed in the future .

"I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
As we all know , technology and science is developing quickly nowadays .
So there is a big market on producting and consuming on cars .
How could human beings can drop this golden opportunity to make money ?

Fisrt , if you live in a big city with a car available , you can easily get to the destination where you want to be .
You do n't need to get on crowded buses and waste a long time just for waiting buses ' coming .
For examples , in the late evening if you have something urgent and also we know that it is really hard to get a taxi or bus , then at that moment you got a car , your problem will be soon solved .

Second , now cars are invented in different styles and even you can choose what contents in it .
So they are access to your needs such as high-quality stero inside the car .
Then you can enjoy the music during your driving .
And more and more cars will be produced by car factories .
The price of cars must be dropped to the level that ordinary people can afford it .

Finally , new energies are being invented by scientists .
They will soon be used instead of petrol and gasoline .
That is to say that cars will scarcely pollute our environment .
So we do n't need to worry about those gases such as carbon dioxides and acid rain which destroy atmosphere and constructures of our city .

All in all , we can clearly see that how a car is convenient to our life .
My friends always proud of that their can drive a car and they are very addicted to the enjoyment of process in driving .

"Nowadays , cars virtually become part of our daily lives .
It is hard to imagine what the life will be without a car .
We drive cars to shool , to office , to shoping malls , and , on weekends , to national parks .
But if you ask me what will be the case twenty years later , I would hazard a guess that there will be fewer cars !

To begin with , energy shortage looms larger nowadays .
Recent years wittness the skyroketing the crude oil prices is an example to illustrate the demand for oil far excesses the supply of it .
The excess demand drives the price of the fuels drastically , so people will find it expensive to drive a car .
Probably using public transportations is a more economical choice to travel to school , to office and so on .
In that case there will be fewer cars in use .

Another reason that may attribute to the shrinking of car usage is that cars , through burning fossil fuels , will pollute the environment .
The exhaust of cars contains large amount of toxic gases such as sulfur and nitrigen oxicide , etc .
When the pollution becomes more and more severe , the government will take measure to control the expansion of cars .
The most possible measures are to levy higher taxes on using cars and to grant less driving licence to drivers .
Under such conditions , people will have less incentive to buy cars and use cars .

In addition , the room for accomodating more cars is very limited .
Today we already feel very crowded on roads and parking lots .
If cars continue to expand , we will have more and more severe traffic jams , which will render car transportation slow .
If people find that they are always late in class or office , they will resort to alternative means of transportation such as bicycles and subways .

Taking into consideration all these factors mentioned , private car drivers as well as potential car buyers may think twice before using cars .
Twenty years later , cars may turn out to be an expensive and inconvenient way of going out .

People become so accustomed to having cars that they will not believe it if you tell them in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Why would you need to go out ?
Why would you need a car ?
Simple supply and demand knowledge will reveal that if there is no longer a need for cars to substitute our legs to travel from places to places , there will be fewer cars manufactured .
Things have become so convenient that cars are no longer `` convenient '' .

We will use up our energy resources within a century .
In twenty years ' time , petroleum will become so expensive that perhaps the cost of the fuel will be higher than the car itself .
By then , cars will become a most luxurious item that people can no longer afford .
Less well-off families would most probably use the Mass Transit Railway or public transport instead .

"I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
My conviction is based on three reasons .

First , the low birthrate in many countries will cause a sharp reduction in the number of future drivers .
It is a well-established fact that the largest number of drivers are found in developed countries in North America , Europe and Japan .
It is also clear that birthrate has been dropping during the past decades in these regions .
With the reduction of population , there will certainly be a reduction in the number of drivers and cars .
It can be argued that China is a rising market for cars .
However , I do not believe that the growth in Chinese market will make up for the loss in other places .
Besides , the largest number of cars are found in the east coast big cities , where the streets are already jammed with cars and cannot make room to hold more .

Second , the gas shortage will help to reduce the number of cars .
The energy crisis that we are facing today will also be faced by the next generation .
Due to the limited energy supply on this planet , people in the future years will define gas shortage as a more serious problem than we do .
Considering the difficulty of discovering an alternative energy to replace gas , I am convinced that change of numbers of car will be pretty obvious in the near future .

Third , the reduction of number of cars is and will continue to be fueled by people 's rising concern of the environmental issues .
Over the past decades , people have come to realize that the substances emitted by vehicles will cause an unrevocable damage to our environment .
With the progress made in our understanding to the earth , it will become even clearer that cars using the currently available fuels will have a long-term , negative effects on the atmosphere and our health .

In summary , I have full confidence that , due to the low birthrate , gas shortage and people 's environmental awareness , there will be fewer cars in the twenty years to come .

"In 20 Years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today

With the constant advancement of technology in our world today , many solutions to problems we face today can be solved .
Certain issues that can be seen to have always been discussed and debated over , time after time can probably come to an end .
Through advancements of technology and the convenience that cars seem to have brought to human beings , it came hand in hand with a number of issues that are widely discussed today .
First of all , there is the pollution issue that rises or declines with the usage of cars .
Next , there is the depletion of scarce resources that we use to fuel our cars .
Last but not least , is the cost of purchasing a car and the gas to fuel it .
It is because of these issues , that there is a high chance that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Pollution contributes to the usage rate of cars within a country .
Take Bangkok , a city that is polluted and notorious for its traffic jams as an example .
People living in Bangkok are probably immune to the amount of pollution that they breathe and interact with everyday .
Tourists however , are a different story in terms of the pollution rate in Thailand .
Some complain of bad skin , some claim of constant coughs , some complain on blurred vision with the amount of smoke on the streets .
When the pollution rate of a city is so high , there will be a reduction in the amount of cars that are used .
The government will most probably bring out policies that control the amount of cars through means of indirect tax on cars and the amount of roads that they allow to pass through at a given time period .
In this case , it would just be convenient for people to travel through modes of public transportation .
When there are tax on cars , lesser people will purchase cars , and for convenience purposes , more will use public transportation .
Thereby , reducing the amount of cars that are being bought and driven on a daily basis .

Following that would be the depletion of scarce resources of gas .
The escalating oil prices have made headlines more than once in any form of mass media worldwide .
The Thai government had subsidized the oil price from rising in Thailand for quite a while , and this allow the Thais to continue their transportation as they wish .
However , after the Thai government ceased to subsidize the oil price , did public modes of transportation like the subway become overcrowded .
With the gradual depletion of scarce resources like that of oil that fuels the car in which we drive in , the costs for the scarce resource will rise .
When a price of a good rises , this will discourage the consumers from purchasing such a product .
It can be seen that oil fuels cars , so without fuel for cars , there will be adequate reason to purchase or use more cars .
In this case , the amount of cars that are used today and in twenty years time will most likely have decreased substantially .

Last but not least is the better alternatives that our technology is coming up with .
On a day-to-day basis , there are advancements of technology seen everywhere .
Even after the rising gas costs , countries turned to alternatives of gas .
In a few years of course , it can most probably be assumed that gas will run out so another alternative will have to be thought of .
Now with the convenience of public transportation in the sense that it is more efficient , less time consuming and cheaper in terms of gas and maintainence price of the car .
Most people will be turning to public modes of transportation as opposed to private modes of transportation in travelling in cars .
More and more people are becoming educated , and this has increased in the awareness of the environment .
People will then try to reduce the amount of pollution by using less of products that produce pollution by finding other alternatives like that of using public modes of transportation .
In this case , because cars produce a significant amount of pollution to our world , the amount of car purchases will have decreased quite a deal .
Hence , it can probably be seen and assumed that within 20 years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

With escalating oil costs and pollution , gradual depletion of scarce resources , better technology that can come up with alternatives and enivornmental friendly people , the amount of cars that will be purchased in the next few years will be gradually declining .
Therefore , it can be assumed that in 20 years time , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

However , virtually every household in America possesses at least one such vehicle , often two .
I do n't think people are going to throw away their beloved sedan simply because someone recently invented a new fancy toy that rolls on two wheels and requires no gas .
They simply put too much money into their cars , spent too much time with them , to throw them away for the next new fad .
When the cars break own , they 'll probably jsut buy a new one instead of giving a new invention a try , since they prefer familiarity over the unknown .

People often complain about how cars create pollution , with all the fuels they burn , the exhaust they produce , and all the wasted metal when they break down or outlive themselves .

People do n't care about the polution problem enough to quit driving and take up biking , and major car companies squish their fears by insisting that they are producing more efficent , cleaner cars even as they speak .
Therefore , I believe it 's safe to conclude that the number of cars will actually rise within twenty years , not drop .

As gasoline prices have shot up , the number of people buying cars have dropped slightly , but not by enough for anyone to really notice .
As the demand for motor oil increases , so will the number of enterprises that go out searching for the stuff .
Thus , if anything , the oil supply will increase in twenty years .
Even if they fail to find anymore gasoline resveres , the car companies will most likely develop cars that run off other fuels , such as hydrogen , fuel cells , or simply electricity .
As the fuel gets cheap , so will the cars .
As the cars get cheaper , peopel start buying more .

Besides large cars , innovative transportation and super size bicycle , a decent in population is sure to contribute to a drop in the number of cars .

Not many newly-married couples choose to have kids , so this directly leads to the situation .
Since there will be fewer people in the world , how can there be more cars on the roads ?

I strongly agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today twenty years later in consideration of economic , earth-friendly , and technological factors .

First , the great number of cars and the shortage of oil trouble many industrial countries in the world .
Generally speaking , cars are proved to be the worst efficient transportation .
It is because that we usually drive alone but a car can take at least four people at a time .
The space is not used is a waste of time and money .
People will rethink about the necessarity of driving cars , especially when the price of the oil is so expensive .
Driving cars is not an economic choice at all today .

The second reason why I think cars will be replaced soon is that cars bring out too many disadvantages to both human and the earth .
Even though that sometimes people think that it is very convenient to drive a car , it cause more pollution than we expect , such as noise and air pollution .
Many studies show that the air pollution caused by cars have negative impacts on the fertility of animals .
Not mention that the noise pollution causes health problems .
Therefore , I think the natural resource on earth , the most precious treasure shared by all human and animals , should be protected by using less cars .

Lastly , technologies will change the way of life when it comes to the desperate needs of customers .
Many scientists and businessmen today are looking forward to having some new mass transit system or inventions to replace the cars .
Take the Internet for example , people can take online course and do online shopping without driving out .
Hence , maybe twenty years later , we do not need cars to go to another place .
Instead , we can do all the things by the aids of technologies in communication and transportation .

In summary , I believe that the numbers of cars will decrease in twenty years for cars consume too much oil , cars cause a series of pollution , and more cutting-age mass transit system will be provided .
As a result , I think that the decreasing of cars will be just around the corner .

"I respectfully disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While guided tours can offer convenience and access to information, independent travel provides a more personalized and enriching experience.

One of the main reasons why independent travel is preferable is the freedom it offers. When traveling in a group with a tour guide, the itinerary is predetermined, limiting the flexibility to explore off-the-beaten-path locations or spend more time at places of personal interest. Independent travelers have the freedom to create their own schedules and make spontaneous decisions, leading to a more authentic and tailored experience.

Moreover, independent travel encourages self-reliance and problem-solving skills. Navigating unfamiliar environments, interacting with locals, and overcoming challenges contribute to personal growth and cultural understanding. In contrast, relying on a tour guide for every aspect of the trip can inhibit opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery.

Additionally, independent travelers have the chance to connect more deeply with local communities. By staying in guesthouses, dining at family-owned restaurants, and participating in local activities, independent travelers can support small businesses and engage in meaningful cultural exchanges that may be overlooked in a guided tour setting.

In conclusion, while guided tours can be convenient, independent travel offers a more personalized, flexible, and enriching experience that fosters personal growth and cultural understanding.",P6,CHI,high,1
"When it comes to traveling, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the best way to explore the world. However, I personally disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While group tours can offer convenience and structure, they may not always provide the most authentic and personalized experience.

Traveling independently allows for greater flexibility and freedom to tailor the trip to one's own interests and pace. When you are not bound by a preset itinerary, you have the opportunity to discover hidden gems off the beaten path and interact more closely with locals. For example, during a solo trip to Italy, I stumbled upon a charming family-owned trattoria recommended by a local, which turned out to be a highlight of my journey.

Moreover, independent travel promotes self-reliance and problem-solving skills, as you must navigate unfamiliar places and situations on your own. These experiences can lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of different cultures. In contrast, relying on a tour guide for every aspect of the trip may limit your ability to challenge yourself and step out of your comfort zone.

In conclusion, while group tours have their advantages, I believe that independent travel offers a richer and more rewarding experience overall. By venturing out on your own, you open yourself up to a world of possibilities and unforgettable memories that may not be possible within the confines of a guided tour.",P6,CHI,high,1
"Traveling in a group led by a tour guide certainly has its merits, but is it truly the best way to explore the world? Let's delve into this topic to uncover the complexities and nuances of group travel.

One argument in favor of group travel with a tour guide is the convenience and efficiency it offers. With a guide leading the way, travelers can relax and enjoy the experience without worrying about logistics or navigation. Moreover, tour guides often provide valuable insights and historical context that enhance the overall journey.

On the other hand, solo travel or traveling with a small group can offer a more personalized and flexible experience. When you are not bound by a strict itinerary, you have the freedom to immerse yourself in the local culture, interact with locals, and explore off-the-beaten-path destinations at your own pace. This kind of authentic engagement can lead to more memorable and meaningful travel experiences.

Ultimately, the best way to travel depends on individual preferences and the specific destination. While group travel with a tour guide can be convenient and informative, it may not always allow for the same level of spontaneity and authenticity that independent travel offers. So, ask yourself: What kind of traveler are you Ã¢ÂÂ one who seeks convenience and structure, or one who craves adventure and authenticity?",P6,CHI,high,1
"Traveling in a group led by a tour guide can be a wonderful way to explore new destinations, but it is not necessarily the best way for everyone. While a tour guide can provide valuable insights, historical context, and take care of logistical details, traveling independently also has its unique benefits.

One of the main advantages of traveling in a group with a tour guide is the convenience and efficiency it offers. A guide can help navigate unfamiliar locations, provide local knowledge, and ensure that you make the most of your time in each destination. Additionally, traveling in a group can enhance safety and security, especially in unfamiliar or potentially risky areas.

On the other hand, independent travel allows for more flexibility and personalized experiences. When traveling solo or with a small group of friends, you have the freedom to create your own itinerary, choose your own pace, and explore off-the-beaten-path locations that may not be included in traditional tour packages. This can lead to more authentic cultural experiences and a deeper connection with the places you visit.

In conclusion, while traveling in a group with a tour guide can be a convenient and informative experience, it is not necessarily the best way to travel for everyone. The choice between group travel and independent exploration ultimately depends on individual preferences and travel goals.",P6,CHI,high,1
"I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While guided tours can offer convenience and some level of expertise, they often limit the flexibility and authentic experiences that solo or independent travel can provide.

Firstly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can restrict one's ability to explore at their own pace and delve into personal interests. Tour guides usually follow a set itinerary and schedule, leaving little room for spontaneity or individual preferences. This can result in a superficial understanding of the destination and prevent travelers from fully immersing themselves in the local culture.

Furthermore, guided tours can be expensive, as they often include additional fees for the services of the tour guide and may not cater to all budget levels. Independent travel allows for more flexibility in choosing accommodations, transportation, and activities, enabling travelers to tailor their experiences to their preferences and financial means.

In addition, traveling independently allows for a more authentic and immersive cultural experience. Interacting with locals, navigating public transportation, and discovering hidden gems off the beaten path are all aspects of independent travel that can enrich one's journey and create lasting memories.

In conclusion, while tour guides can provide convenience and information, the best way to travel is ultimately subjective and depends on individual preferences. Independent travel offers greater flexibility, authenticity, and the opportunity for personal growth and discovery, making it a more fulfilling and enriching experience than traveling in a group led by a tour guide.",P6,CHI,high,1

Firstly, a tour guide provides valuable expertise and knowledge about the destination, ensuring that travelers have a deeper understanding and appreciation of the places they visit. Tour guides are well-versed in the history, culture, and local customs of the area, enriching the travel experience.

Secondly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide offers a sense of security and convenience. The guide takes care of all the logistics, such as transportation, accommodation, and itinerary planning, allowing travelers to relax and enjoy their trip without worrying about the details. In unfamiliar or foreign locations, having a knowledgeable guide can help navigate potential challenges and ensure a smooth and hassle-free journey.

Moreover, traveling in a group provides a sense of camaraderie and companionship. Sharing experiences with fellow travelers can enhance the enjoyment of the trip, fostering new friendships and creating lasting memories. Group travel also offers opportunities for social interaction, cultural exchange, and shared exploration, enriching the overall travel experience.

Traveling independently allows individuals to tailor their experiences to their preferences. For instance, solo travelers or small groups can explore off-the-beaten-path locations, immerse themselves in local cultures, and have unique encounters that may not be included in traditional tour packages. Moreover, independent travelers have the flexibility to change plans on a whim, stay longer in a place they love, or skip attractions that do not interest them.

Additionally, traveling independently promotes self-reliance and problem-solving skills. Navigating unfamiliar destinations, interacting with locals, and making decisions on the go can lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of different cultures.

"I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While guided tours have their advantages, independent travel offers unique benefits that can enhance the overall experience.

Firstly, traveling independently allows for greater flexibility and spontaneity. When you are not tied to a group itinerary, you have the freedom to explore at your own pace, linger in places that captivate you, and change your plans on a whim. For instance, during my solo trip to Thailand, I stumbled upon a hidden beach that was not part of any guided tour. Being able to discover such hidden gems made my journey truly unforgettable.

Secondly, traveling on your own enables you to immerse yourself more fully in the local culture. Without a tour guide filtering your experiences, you have the opportunity to interact more authentically with locals, try new foods, and delve into off-the-beaten-path destinations. For example, when I traveled solo to Japan, I stayed in a traditional ryokan, participated in a tea ceremony, and learned about the art of calligraphy from a local artist. These experiences enriched my understanding of the country in ways that a guided tour could not have replicated.

In conclusion, while guided tours can provide convenience and valuable insights, independent travel offers unparalleled freedom, spontaneity, and cultural immersion.

While there are certainly benefits to traveling with a tour guide, such as convenience and access to insider knowledge, I believe that the most enriching and memorable experiences come from traveling independently.

When you travel in a group led by a tour guide, you may have a structured itinerary that limits your ability to explore off the beaten path or deviate from the planned activities. This can lead to a more superficial understanding of the destination and a lack of personal connection to the places you visit.

For example, during my solo trip to Japan, I had the flexibility to wander through the bustling streets of Tokyo, get lost in the serene temples of Kyoto, and interact with locals without feeling rushed or constrained by a group. These spontaneous moments of discovery and connection were the highlights of my trip and would not have been possible if I had been part of a guided tour.

For example, during a recent trip to Italy, our knowledgeable tour guide not only navigated us through the bustling streets of Rome but also shared fascinating stories about the ancient ruins and iconic landmarks, making the trip more enriching and memorable.

Secondly, traveling in a group with a tour guide ensures safety and security, especially in unfamiliar or potentially risky locations. The tour guide is responsible for coordinating logistics, managing any unforeseen issues, and ensuring that the group stays together, minimizing the chances of getting lost or encountering difficulties. This was evident during a hiking expedition in the Himalayas, where our guide's expertise in navigating challenging terrain and handling emergencies reassured us and allowed us to focus on enjoying the breathtaking landscapes.

Lastly, traveling with a group and a tour guide fosters a sense of community and camaraderie among like-minded individuals who share a passion for exploration. It provides opportunities to make new friends, share experiences, and create lasting memories together. In today's fast-paced world, where social connections are often fleeting, group travel offers a chance to form meaningful relationships and bond over shared adventures.

"**Title: The Case for Independent Travel: Freedom and Authenticity**

Is traveling in a group with a tour guide truly the ultimate way to explore the world? While some may argue that it offers convenience and structure, I firmly believe that the best way to travel is independently. Why limit yourself to a predetermined itinerary when you can chart your own course and make authentic connections with the places you visit?

One of the key advantages of independent travel is the freedom it provides. When you travel solo or with a small group of friends, you have the flexibility to tailor your trip to your interests and preferences. Do you want to spend an extra day exploring a hidden gem you stumbled upon? With independent travel, the choice is entirely yours. In contrast, tour groups often operate on a tight schedule, leaving little room for spontaneity and personal exploration.

Moreover, independent travel allows for a more immersive and authentic experience. When you navigate a new destination on your own, you have the opportunity to interact with locals, try authentic cuisine, and discover hidden treasures off the beaten path. These genuine encounters can enrich your understanding of a culture far more than following a tour guide from one tourist hotspot to another.

In conclusion, while guided tours have their merits, the freedom and authenticity that come with independent travel make it the superior choice for adventurous souls seeking a deeper connection with the world.

However, traveling independently allows for more flexibility and freedom to explore at your own pace. It enables you to tailor your trip according to your interests and preferences, rather than following a fixed schedule set by a tour guide. Independence also allows for spontaneous discoveries and interactions with locals that may not be possible in a structured group tour.

For example, when I traveled solo to Japan, I was able to immerse myself in the local culture, try authentic cuisine, and interact with the locals on a deeper level. This experience would have been limited if I had been part of a group tour led by a guide.

While some may thrive in the structured environment of a group tour, others may prefer the freedom and independence of exploring on their own.

"I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While tour guides can provide valuable insights and information about a destination, traveling solo or in a smaller group allows for more flexibility, independence, and personalized experiences.

One of the main benefits of traveling independently is the freedom to explore at your own pace and follow your own interests. When you are not constrained by a tour group's schedule, you can spend more time at places that captivate you and discover hidden gems off the beaten path. Additionally, solo travelers are more likely to interact with locals and immerse themselves in the culture, leading to a deeper and more authentic travel experience.

Moreover, traveling independently allows for greater spontaneity and the opportunity to make last-minute decisions based on your mood or preferences. You can change your itinerary on the fly, take detours, or simply relax and unwind without feeling rushed or obligated to follow a strict agenda set by a tour guide.

In conclusion, while tour guides can be beneficial for some travelers, the freedom, flexibility, and personalized experiences that come with independent travel make it the superior option for those seeking a more enriching and fulfilling journey.",P6,CHI,high,1
"I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While guided tours can offer convenience and insights, traveling independently provides a more authentic and enriching experience.

Firstly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide often restricts freedom and flexibility. Itineraries are predetermined, leaving little room for spontaneous exploration or personalized experiences. Traveling independently allows individuals to tailor their trips according to their interests and pace, enabling a deeper connection with the destination.

Moreover, relying on a tour guide can create a barrier between travelers and the local culture. Tourist groups tend to follow a set path, interacting with locals in a superficial manner. In contrast, independent travelers have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the local community, fostering genuine connections and a better understanding of the destination.

Additionally, traveling independently promotes self-reliance and problem-solving skills. Navigating unfamiliar places, communicating in different languages, and making decisions on the go all contribute to personal growth and confidence.

"I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are several reasons why this is the case.

Firstly, having a tour guide provides a wealth of knowledge and expertise about the destination. They can offer historical and cultural insights that enhance the overall travel experience. For example, in Rome, a tour guide can bring ancient ruins to life by explaining their significance and historical context.

Secondly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide offers safety and security. The guide is familiar with the local customs, language, and potential dangers, ensuring that travelers can navigate unfamiliar environments with ease. This is particularly important in countries where language barriers and safety concerns may be prevalent.

Furthermore, traveling with a tour guide in a group allows for a more organized and efficient itinerary. The guide can plan out the best routes, activities, and timings to maximize the travel experience. This ensures that travelers make the most of their time in a destination without feeling overwhelmed or lost.

In conclusion, traveling in a group led by a tour guide offers numerous benefits such as knowledge, safety, and organization. It enhances the overall travel experience and allows travelers to immerse themselves in new cultures and destinations with confidence.",P6,CHI,high,1
"I respectfully disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While there are benefits to traveling in a group with a guide, such as convenience and access to insider knowledge, traveling independently offers a more authentic and personalized experience.

This autonomy enables travelers to explore off-the-beaten-path destinations and immerse themselves in the local culture without being confined to a rigid itinerary set by a tour guide.

Additionally, independent travel promotes self-discovery and personal growth. Navigating unfamiliar places, interacting with locals, and overcoming challenges on your own can boost confidence and independence. These experiences often lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and the world around them.

Moreover, independent travelers have the opportunity to connect with locals on a more intimate level, fostering genuine cultural exchange and meaningful relationships. This type of interaction is less likely in a large group setting led by a tour guide, where the focus is often on ticking off popular tourist attractions.

Traveling solo or with a small group of friends can lead to unexpected adventures and meaningful interactions with locals.

"In a world where travel options abound, the debate over the best way to explore a new destination rages on. Some argue that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the ideal way to experience a place, while others prefer the freedom of independent exploration. Where do you stand on this issue? 

While there are certainly benefits to traveling with a tour guide, such as convenience, safety, and insider knowledge, it ultimately boils down to personal preference. Are you someone who thrives on structure and enjoys having a knowledgeable guide to lead the way, or do you prefer the thrill of forging your own path and discovering hidden gems off the beaten track? 

For those who value efficiency and ease of planning, a group tour with a guide can offer a stress-free experience. The guide can handle logistics, provide historical and cultural context, and ensure that you don't miss out on any must-see attractions. However, some may argue that this type of travel can feel restrictive and overly scripted, lacking the spontaneity and authenticity that comes with independent exploration. 

In the end, the best way to travel is a highly personal choice that depends on individual preferences and travel styles.

"As matter of fact , the issue whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a complex one .
Different person has his own oppnions according to his background .
As for me , I would like to agree that the best way to travel is travel alone , but not travel led by a tour guide .
The following discussion will provide evidence to support my claim .

First of all , travelers could have more flexible time to operate without a tour guide .
Because if travelor follow a tour guide , it means he entered in a traveling plan made by a comany , it also mean that all the attractions , time , restaurent are scheduled and fixed .
So , the traveler can not do anything just follow the schedule and lack a lot of fun .
But if the travelor have a trip alone , it can easily change a plan .
For example , if we find another attraction during a trip , we can easily stop to see it .
if we like to chinese food , it is ok , we can enter a Chinese restaurent instead of KFC , Burger King and so on .
Do n't you think the example quoted above could reach the conclusion that travelors could more flexbily opperate time according to their likeness and dislikeness .

Secondly , travelers who take a trip by themself without a tour guid could exercise their abilities in organizing , planning and preparation .
If the traveler take the trip alone , it means that he need book the hotel in advance , organize the route and so on .
But if the traveler enter a group led by a tour guide , all he have to do is following to the guide .
For example , i took a trip to Washingtone DC this summer .
At first , i have to book a hotel , and then prepare for the problems and plan for the travel .
After all this done , I feel that my ability of planning is improving .
That is great !
Do n't you think ?
Thus , the example persuasively illustrate that travel alone help much in personal ability .

Admittedly , travel alone without a tour guid has it 's own demerits .
since travelers are usually familiar with the place that they are going to , it could cause a lot problems such as lost .
However , the advantages of travel alone weight much than disvantages of that .
So the it is more striking conclusion .

To sum up , due to the discussion mentioned above , the reasons which combined together could be more persuasive than any single one .
It is more comfortable for us to claim that the best way to travel is travel alone .

"Nowadays , people love to travel since it is not a hard thing to do anymore after the invention of aeroplanes .
Traveling is definitely a good idea to explore more about other countries , learn about other culture and also relax yourself from the intense work .
Some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
However , I do not agree with this statment and I think traveling on your own , or with your family or close friends , is a better choice .

Traveling is assumed to be a relaxing activity during holidays .
If you travel with a group of people led by a tour guide , you may not get the relaxing result due to two reasons .
First , you do not have the right to choose whom to go with .
If you are in a group that has some people with bad personalities or hard to get along with , your trip will be ruined .
Second , usually the tour guide plans a tight schdule for the group since he or she wants to show the group as much as possible .
You may have to stay up until eleven or even twelve at night but be asked to wake up at around six or seven in the morning .
After traveling , you may actually feel more tired than before , which is not relaxing at all .

If you go traveling on your own , then you will have to plan the trip all by yourself , which is indeed a fun thing to do .
While you are planning thr trip , you have to do research about the place that you will visit .
Although this may be time-consuming , you know more about the place by reading the culture and probably a little bit history of the place .
Not only can this widen your horizon , but also increase your interest about the place you will be traveling .
You will then have more fun during the real trip .

Also , finding the tour that has the combination of places that you want to visit is hard .
Even you get the right combination , you may not get the time that you want to stay , the hotel that you like or the length of the trip that you want .
If you really find your perfect tour , you may find its price is unreasonably high .

In a word , the ideal way to travel is on your own .
You can decide everything by yourself and also spend the amount of money that you want to spend .
This is the way to have a really relaxing and fun trip you want .

"Nowadays , more and more people prefer to travel when they have holiday .
Is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide ?
Different people have different answers .
As far as I am concerned , I totally disagree with the statement .
Travelling in a group has three main negative function : rigid , expensive and boring .

First , travelling in a group is not flexible .
People going out for trip is for relax .
However , travelling in a group sometimes makes people feel more stress .
People are busy during the workdays .
Of course they do not wish as busy as usual when they are on holiday .
There is a rigid timetable in a group .
Nobody will wait you if you sleep late or you want to stay in a place longer .
If people go to travel alone , they can change their timeable anytime and do not need to waste time on these places where they do not like .

In addition , travelling in a group is very expensive .
Travelling with a tour guide needs to pay some more money to the guide 's instruction .
It is a extra payment .
People should save these money so that they can go to more places .
Guides usually take visitor to some special stores for shopping .
Actually , the goods in these shops are much expensive than nomal shops and most of them are old-fashion or have something broken .
People want to use more money to make the trip more colorful .
However , they cannot get a equal service as they pay .

Finally , travelling in a group takes off almost half fun of a trip .
According to the recent research , people have more fun when they search the information of the places they will visit than visiting itself .
People collect information from newpaper , TV programs and Internet and when they go to the place , they feel familar and more interesting .
If travelling with a tour guide , there is no need to search the information because the guide will tell you everything about the place .

All in all , takin into consideration I have discussed , travelling in a group is not the best way to travel .
Not only cannot the timetable be changed , but also it is a waste of money and take off the interesting of searching as well .

"I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In my opinion , traveling alone or in an autonomous small group offers more depth and freedom to a trip .
However , traveling with a group and guide also has certain aspects that may appeal to people with different tastes .

Traveling alone or in a small group often means a less rigid and more flexible travel plan .
You are only limited by when the plane/boat/bus arrives or leaves .
Everything else , from where to stay , where to dine , or what sites to visit , can be arranged on the fly or changed on a whim .
For example , a trip to Europe originally meant to see the great castles of the middle ages can easily be changed to an exciting adventure focusing on the modern night clubs of Paris .
In most tour groups , the whole trip is planned out in advance , the hotels booked , the tours arranged .
In my opinion , this lack of freedom means that you are n't able to pursue what interests you most about the place you are traveling in , and instead must conform to what the tour guide chooses as `` worth seeing '' or `` interesting '' .

Another benefit of independent traveling is the possibility of more depth to the whole experience .
As mentioned before , most tour groups have to follow a rigid schedule .
Take the Europe trip for example again ; if you were to come across a beautiful , intricate little chapel in the castle you are visiting , you could stay there for the rest of the day if you wished to , taking in the beauty of the place at leisure .
On the other hand , if you were in a tour group , the only way to appreciate that beautiful chapel would probably be to sacrifice a restroom break in the hopes of snapping a few extra pictures .
Another example would be visiting a museum , if you are going with a guide and group , the experience will be limited to what the guide can show you , often no more than a rushed glance of the most famous works , and then it 's off to the next piece .
However , visiting a museum alone means that you are able to appreciate all the artwork that interests you , without the pressure to leave in time for dinner .

However , it must also be acknowledged that traveling in a group with a guide can have several advantages as well .
Most importantly is that the tour guide is often someone familiar with the local language and customs , which can make arrangements of dining and lodging easier .
Most tour group agencies also have deals with the local hotels and retaurants , which in turn means cheaper deals or better quality accomodations .
For someone who travels to relax , eat good food , and stay at five star hotels , it would be better to go with a group .

In conclusion , I think the best way to travel is not in a group led by a guide , but rather alone or with a small group .
This is because that I treasure freedom and the potential for a deeper experience more than the conveniences of traveling with a group .

"When it comes to the topic of tour , there are many perspectives about the best way to have a enjoyable travel .
Some people may hold the view that it is travel in a group led by a tour guide that provides the best method .
However , as far as I am concerned , travel with friends or other acqaintences without a tour guied is a more rational chioce .

Obviously the fundamental element to decide which way to take a travel is what you want to acquire from the travel .
Do you choose to travel for the scenery , relax or business ?
The reponse is different from person to person .
However , the most possible case if for both scenery and relax .
So the tour guide accompanying the travel group might give rise to some negative effect from that degree .
Why ?
Considering you are traveling with your best friends to Paris , one of the most romantic cities in the world , it 's normal even irresitible to feel uncomfortable because there is a strange man of woman who is keeps saying besides you for the salary he or she would get from that trip .
Taking this point into consideration , I often choose to travel with my intimate friends or relatives without a tour guide for more natural and comfortable atmosphere which contributes to the enjoyment of my travel indeed .

Furthermore , it is so commen that many people who had chosen to let a tour guide arrange the travel felt very regretful for that decision .
There are many cases which are given by my friends who felt angry about the tour guides .
Some of them complained that the tour guide were ethusiastic about leading them to expensive and extravagent stores rather than illustrating the history and scene of the scenic place .
Others felt disappointed because the tour guide arranged the travel in a tight schedul which made them feel so exhausted after the trip .
Such types of complains are numerous which demonstrate the flaws and drawbacks of travel led by a tour guide .

So if we take a careful consideration of that issue , it 's not difficult to make the conclusion that the best way to travel is without a tour guide rather than with a tour guide .
",P6,CHI,high,0
"Though some people might think travelling in a group arranged by the travel agent is the most suitable way of travelling , I strongly disagree with it and I consider the best way to travel is by individuals .

In my first place , the cost of travelling by individuals is significantly lower than by a group .
You need to pay more service charges to the tour guide , to the hotel , or any additional charges when travelling in a group , You may have a question in mind , `` What is the cost difference between them ? ''
From my experience to Boston in United States , travelling in a group would cost about HK $ 10,000 , while travelling by individuals would cost about $ HK 6,000 .
It is only two-third of the cost by travelling in a group .

My second reason is that travel in a group is not flexible for the schedule of your trip .
You need to follow a standard schedule to eat , to play or to wake up at specific times while it just likes working .

The main purpose of have a trip is to relax while the tight schedule would not make this original goal effective .
For instance , if I want to stay a place for a longer time and enjoy more there , it is up to my decision by travelling alone .
I can manage my time in my own interest instead of following a standard time schedule .

Finally , I consider that travelling alone would explore more than you expected .
You can decide to go to any places to learn the different customs where it would really broaden your horizons and make you become independent .
You can obtain any kinds of information by finding them out yourself and get a deeper insight on them .
For example , you can live in a host family for a couple of days to experience their culture .
This would be really beneficial to you .

To conclude , I love the experience that only travelling alone would give me .

"I disagree with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group lead by a tour guide .
Since traveling is often for leisure and entertainment , traveling in a group with a tourn guide would restrict my individual interests , my pace , and the intimacy of the group dynamic .

First , traveling is supposed to be enjoyable for the tourists .
Although a tour guide may be able to lead the group toward the major and well-known attractions , in his or her attempt to appeal to the majority of the tourists , many tourists ' individual interests may be compromised .
For instance , if the town is internationally famous for its wine but also has a nice but small museum of WWI artifacts , the tour guide is most likely going to focus on wine tasting rather than the historical artifacts .
However , one of the tourists in the group may be a history buff and is hoping to expand his collection of WWI artifacts , he or she may miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime conforming to group interests .
Thus , in many such cases , traveling is better done individually or in a small group of friends rather than in a group led by a tourn guide .

Also , traveling is a chance to only to see and experiences new things but also to unwind .
Thus , the pace offered by a tour guide may restrict one 's ability to relax .
For instance , in a tour group , there may be people of all ages groups .
Typically , the younger tourists would be more energetic , attempting to see everything and speeding up the group 's pace .
However , the older people in the group may just be hoping to relax and enjoy the view at few select locations .
Thus , the disparity between the goals and pace of the tourists in the group may restrict many 's traveling experience and may even be the cause of additional stress .

Finally , much intimacy and freedom is loss when traveling in group led by a tour guide .
Since tour groups are usually composed of random people across the nation , or even across the world , it may be difficult to feel comfortable in their presence .
Also , when traveling in such a large and unfamiliar group , freedom of speech and behavior is lost .
For instance , with adults around , teengers wo n't be able to blast the music they love on the radio and with the children around , the adults wo n't be able to talk about many of the personal details of their life .
Conversation tend to become more superficial and restricted .
Hence , in many cases , traveling in such a group led by a tour guide is not the best choice .

Thus , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
With restricted interest , pace , and freedom , I would not have a good traveling experience and I think many would feel the same way .

"I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
The advantage is that when going on a trip , you are not familiar with the place , so being led by a tour guide is better than going around the place by yourself and getting lost .
The disadvantage is that you ca n't choose which place to go to , you also have to wake up very early and get prepared for the journey you are having that day .

Last year , I went to Guilin , which is in China .
My family hired a tour guide .
I remember that we had to wake up at 7am and had to be ready by 7:30am .
We went around the city and my legs were very sore by the time we returned to the hotel .
The tour guide was not really friendly and my family was not pleased with her .
We also had to go in a group , which was not such a pleasant experience .
There was another family who was always late for arrivals .
And everybody was displeased with them .

Another experience was that a few years ago in Malaysia , my mother also hired a tour guide .
The tour guide was very greedy and not very polite .
On another trip to Bangkok , we did not hire a tour guide and we went around Bangkok by ourselves .
I think that my family and I had a much more delightful holiday and we had a lot of fun there .

In my opinion , I think that hiring a tour guide is not as good as going around by yourself .
Though you may not know the place very well , you can always ask the local people who live there , I am sure at least one of them is willing to tell you the directions of the place .
Tour guides may not be very professional and their manners may not be that polite .
So I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
",P6,CHI,high,0
"I agree that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide even though some people might prefer travelling on their own .
First , people can make new friends in the tourist group .
When one person travels alone or with his or her family members only , it is quite possible that he or she willl get bored .
If people travel in a group , they can meet different people and make new friends with the group members during the trip .
Generally , tourists will remain in the group till the end of the trip , which provides adequate time for people to get to know each other and make new friends .

Second , to travel in a group would bring more fun .
When people travel alone , they might feel it is a pity that nobody shares this experince with them .
While in a group , people can share this wonderful experience with the group members .
The lasting memory of travelling would be enriched by the happiness added by the group members .

Third , it would be efficient and organized when the tourist group is led by a guide .
The guide would arrange the travel in the best way , which means travellers need not spend a lot of time to plan for the travelling .
Travellers do not need to find information themselves and they do not need to worry about where to sleep at night , how to find the direction or how to take the transportation .
In addition , the tourist guide can provide adquate information for the history and uniqueness of the scenic spots .
The tourists only need to listen to the guide and enjoy themselves .

Because people can make new friends , enjoy and share the travelling experience with others and tourist agency would offer the best arrangement and high efficiency for travelling , I support the idea that the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

"It is sometimes difficult to discuss people 's views on the way of travelling because it is such a multifaceted topic .
Some tend to think that there are many merits to travel by their own plans while others say it is better to be led by a tour guide .
I have developed my own opinions on the topic .
I favor the latter position over the former for several reasons , and I would like to explore two of the conspicuous ones in the following passages .

First of all , if we are led by a guide , we do not have to spend a great amount of time considering where to go and how long to stay .
The guide has already arranged the schedule for us .
As a result , all we have to do is follow the schdule and have a good time .
For instance , when I was a junior high student , my parents and I went to Singapore led by a tour guide .
The tour guide was so familiar with the country that she introduced us everything about Singapore .
Needless to say , we visited the most important spots in the country .
All of us really appreciated the tour guide for such a wonderful trip .

Second thing that must be taken into consideration is that we are likely to make new friends in the group .
It goes without saying that it is very boring when we visit some interesting places without friends .

In the group , we can make good friends with one another and share all the happiness on the trip .
For examples , on the travel to singapore , my new friends and I played together day and night .
They did bring me a lot of fun during the trip .
Though the trip is over for a long time , we have still kept in touch closely .

Of course , I do not suggest that my perspectives are unassailable .
There are still some advantages for us to take a travel on our own plans .
Nevertheless , I think the opinions I have provided above are more important and stronger .
",P6,CHI,high,0
"Although there are more and more tour agencies today and more and more people are willing to be guided in a travel , I prefer to travel by myself , not in a group .

The first thing I should consider when travelling in a group is that I can not arrange all the things by myself .
That is , when travelling in a group , I should follow the certain routine and the certein time table .
I will be asked to follow the schedule step by step .
This makes me feel that I 'm a little baby who can not control itself .
But when travelling by myself .
I make my own plan according to my own taste .
I do n't need to rush in hours from one place to another .
There is a good chance that I can make my own decision .

Second , more and more tour guides have some business relationships with the merchants in some certain areas .
That is , the guides will instigate the visitors to buy the products in the local area .
And the guides will get some benefits as well as the merchants if the visitors buy the products because the guides and the merchants have some contracts .
The guides ' behavior can really mislead some visitors today .
It is more likely for the tourists to make some unwise choices and to buy some products unneccessary when led by a guide .
When travelling alone , I can make more intelligent choice when deciding which to buy and which not to buy .

At last , travelling alone is a good experience for me .
And I always have a desire to travel alone around this world , just like many youths .
When travelling alone , I will schedule all the things by myself , from making a travel plan to booking the tickets .
I think it is a necessary process in one 's life to grow up .
In fact , Although I 'm still seventeen , I have already traveled alone to many different provinces in my country , even to Hong kong .
Each time I finished these trips , I feel that I 'm more mature than before and I have gained more experiences .
My parents also think that if a person cannot do something individually , he or she will not be an adult .
In my opinion , travelling alone is a process for me to gain experience .

So , I would rather to travel alone , not travelling in a group by a tour guide because I 'm that kind of person who is very independent .
",P6,CHI,high,0
"I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because group tour imposes a lot limitation that one may not like .

First , if I travel on my own , I can set my travel duration according to my schedule and convenience .
When I travel with a group , I can only spend a certain amount of time in certain locations .
If I travel on alone , I can choose to stay longer at some of my favorite spots .
Also , I can enjoy my own daily schedule instead of complying with a group tour schedule .
In most group tours , you will have to get up early and stay up late so that you can get to as many places as possible .

Second , I will do more research to learn about the place which I will visit .
This will help me to learn the geographic location , climate , history , and culture of this place .
When I just listen to the tour guide , I tend to forget most of the information but if I do research on my own , I will retain and remember them in the future .
The place that I visit will be more memorable .

Thirdly , economically , I will be able to find economic transportation options , accommodations and even in dinning choices .
Nowadays , many can use airlines rewards to fly free or use hotel accumulated points to stay free or stay for a discount .
This will surely help to save a large sum of money .
Also , if I travel alone , I have the freedom to choose the hotel settings and locations that suit my needs .
In terms of dinning , I can enjoy eating at my time and at places that I prefer .
Food choices is a personal one .
I can surely be more adventurous if I can have my own choice .

All in all , I think that traveling on my own will give me more freedom to explore in many aspects than when I travel with a group .
Afterall when I travel , I want to be in a relaxing mode and be of myself instead of being in a crowd most of the day .

"From Columbia roaming around the world in his ship in search for undiscovered exoctic lands , to a family paying a weekend trip to a nearby state , we could see that people have long been enjoying the pleasure of travelling and being a tourist in foreign land .
When you start planning for a trip in the summer vacation , for instance , what is the first thing that you would do ?
Go to the book store and pick a travel book so you can plan your own ideal trip ?
Or go to a travel agency with your family and book an attractive travelling package ?
For me , I would go for the latter .

Booking a trip at an agency means that you are travelling in a group provided with a tour guide all along the way .
When traveling in a foreign place , a tour guide is unquestionably more experienced that you about every aspect of the place - its history , culture , tourist attractions , and anything other thing that a tourist would like to explore .
Imagine that you are going to France all by yourself , without a tour guide , what would you do if you would like to find a place to dine ?
You would surely ask a passer-by for directions .
But the problem is , you do not speak any French !
Even if you are lucky enough to bump into a resturant , you do not understand a word in the menu .
These problems would be all gone if you have a tour guide along with you .
A tour guide therefore , also helps us to break the language barrier by being the ` tranlsator ' because he is very often a local people from the country .

The second thing why travelling in a group led a tour guide is the possibility of cultural exchanges between the members the group .
You may discuss about things you find interesting along your way or even questions as simple as ` where to go shopping tonight ' .
This way of travel also offers a saver environment because a group is less prone to local crimes such as stealth .
Even if you unfortunately fell ill during the trip , there are people around who will be able to take care of you .

Traveling in a group led by a tour guide is no doubt the best way to travel .
You are lead by someone familiar to the place who will explain everything which comes up to your mind , you are with your friends or family which help you out when you need .
In this way , you are comfortable and fully relaxed , and can enjoy the real pleasure of travelling .

"I do agree with the statement that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
There are four reasons show that it is benifitial to travel in a tour group .

First of all , it is much more safer to travel as a group than by one ' self .
Especially when people want to travel in different country , it is possible for them to get lost or get in troubles .
If they travel in a group , since people can take care and protect each other , the opportunities of getting lost or even get ripped is very small which keep them having a wonderful trip .

Secondly , when travel in a strange country , there are too many things needed to be considered .
Sometimes , it will be exceedingly confused for people to figure out which way to go , what bus to take or even where to live .
For example , once I went to the capital of China , BeiJing with my parents , it should be a wonderful trip for us , since we had no much time to get together .
However , it took us almost the whole day to find a hotel to stay over night which we wasted time and energy .
Eventually , the trip was ended in a unhappy mood and everyone was so tried to even look around .
Threrefore , travel in a group and having a tour guide can make the trip more efficient and easy .

Thirdly , sometimes due to the misunderstanding of different culture , people who do not fimiliar about that culture may make mistakes .
In addition , the mistakes can be very seriours that tourists may cause accident or hurt .
However , having a tour guide can give tourists the best and most accurate suggestions and warns which provide them avoid making unnecessary mistakes .

Lastly , the tour guide always know the best place to shopping of presents for friends or tourists themselves .
Usually , tour guides will set up a day or particular time for shopping , since it is not only about shopping , it is also about the culture in that country or city .
However , if people travel alone , they probobly may not find the cheapest and the best to shop .

In conlustion , I think travel in a group led by a tour guide is a bright idea for saving money and energy , keeping themselves safe and having the most efficient and wonderful trip .

"Every once in a while , we take a vacation and go travelling to different countries .
We want to see and experience other cultures other than our own during these travels .
There are two different ways to do this , either through the leadership of a tour guide or to explore by yourself .

I believe that traveling by yourself without a tour guide is the best way to travel .
First of all , the beauty of exploring is the fact that you do not know what you will find .
If you have a tour guide to tell you all the fun secrets and places , then where is all the fun in that ?
And often , the tour guide and the group will express their own opinions upon the places and objects that you come across .
Which isnt all that good because it limits our insight on the culture we choose to explore .

Secondly , the best way the fully experience a culture , is to roam the streets yourself and find out what interesting objects you see or what happens on the streets .
If you let yourself roam the streets and become part of the society , you will be able to discover and learn many things that you will not be able to learn if you are walking with a tour guide .
In addition to that , learning through experience is a lot better and more satisfying than someone telling you about it .

When you get a vacation to travel , you want to get away from all the stress and authority at work .
If you do not travel with a tour guide , you will be able to acheive that goal more effectively , because if you travel with a tour guide , you will still feel that someone is in charge of your life .

The next time you travel , i highly suggest that you do not hire a tour guide .
A tour guide really limits your travel experiences to mere sightseeing .
Traveling alone and experienceing the culture while becoming one with it is in my opinion , the best way to travel .

"With the rapid development of our society , more and more people can afford travel , whether short-distance or long-distance , internal or oversea .
But which manner do you perfer ?
To travel in a group led by guide or travel alone ?
Different people hold different opinion due to their distinct background .
As far as I am concerned , I perfer the former opinion to the latter one .
My point of view can be greatly substantiated by the following discussion .

The first important reason in favor of my position is that the tour guides in the travel agent are all trained and know much more information about the resort than any tourists , whether the story behind the scenery or the entertainment information .

In the second place , another convincing reason for my propensity is that the expense in group travel will be much lower , due to the scale economy effect in travel industry .
This point also deserves some words here .

Last but not least , guide-leading group is also conductive in some other areas , for instance , we will be much more safety in group and can make friends with the people in the tour group , whom we never heard of before .

Admittedly , traveling alone also has undeniable merits , for example , you can enjoy more freedom and more private space .
But when the advantages and disadvantages of the traveling in tour group and traveling alone are carefully examined , the most stricking conclusion is self-evident .

To sum up , due to the reasons mentioned aboved , it is not difficulty to draw the conclusion that traveling in the group led by a tour guide shoud be taken into consideration when people want to have a trip .
There is not a easy solution to such a complex issue , however , taking into account all the dimensions of the issue discussed above , might be the first step out the dillemma .
",P6,CHI,high,0
"Some people think say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide with a strick schedule .
While this might be true in some circumstances , it is better to travel with a few close friends without a strict schedule .
Traveling with a few close friends without a specific schedule or route allows people to truely experince a place with a constant sense of excitement and exploration .

When traveling with a large group with a tour guide .
The tour guide usually lay out a planned route and informs poeple where the next stop is .
This takes the fun of exploration out of traveling .
Traveling is about seeing new things and explore a place without a person spoon-feeding you of the information about the place .
Different people want to visit different places , because of repective tastes .
Artists might typically visit a museum of natural science , while an archeologist might not be interested in visiting a modern art exhibition .
However , in a large group with a tour guide , there is no freedom to explore a place and skip tourist sites by one 's own will .
Everyone WILL see what everyone else sees .
There is no skipping or revisiting of any particular sites .
Such trips will rarely satisfy any members of the traveling group completely .

However , traveling with a tour guide might prove to be convenient sometimes .
In a foreign country , where the people speak a different language from yours , having a tour guide can save you valuable time and energy asking for directions or prices of items .
The tour guide will help you bypass the frustration of language barrier , since he/she knows the language .
Conversely , hiring a tour guide cost much money .
Without a tour guide , you can travel with more money to spend on hotel and food during the trip .

Traveling in a large group and tour guide can help you safe time and much frustration in a foreign country , which does not use your native language .
However , having a tour guide is expensive , and traveling in a large group ruins the fun of exploring a new place with complete freedom .
If the travelers in a trip are rushed like cattles , grazing past many sites superficially without satisfying anyone 's need in the group , then the trip is not a fulfilling one .
Therefore , such trips should be avoided ( or experienced by just reading internet articles ) .

"When we have an intention to go travelling , we will very often look for travel agencies where the staff there can prvide us with the necessary information .
Another advantage is that if the travel agencies will provide us with a tour guide during our journeys .
The tour guides are able to tell us the history of the place and the informtion about the scenic spots .
However , I believe that the best way to travel is not travelling in a group led by a tour guide , but travelling individually .
There are several advantages .

Firstly , we will seek for information about different places ourselves .
Through the researh work , we have a better knowledge about the places and this will enrich our knowledge .
After that , we can make rational decisions based on our own will .
On the other hand , if we consult travel agencies , we will be greatly influenced by their opinions and this will hinder our decision-making .
Since the travel agencies are profit-making organizations and their common objective is profit maximization , they may not really provide good advice for us .

Secondly , we can choose the destination according to our own will .
For instance , if we enjoy watching natural sceneries , we will look for a place where there are abundance of beautiful and fatastic sceneries .
However , if we are led by a tour guide , we cannot go to everywhere we want because we have to follow the planned schedules which are designed for all the customers and are not particularly designed for us .
Travelling individually can enable us to schedule our own time during the trips .

Thirdly , since we have made research before the trips , we can go to the places we want and to explore the places .
We will get great satisfaction if we find something interesting there becaue it is discovered by ourselves .
Thus , this will create eternal memories in our minds .
If we are led by tour guides , we may be bound to stay at an uniteresting place for a long time .
Consequetly , we will lose the real meaning of travelling , that is , relaxation and entertainment .

"Peoples like to travel around the world , they wants to know the have a very good memory and able to know different culture in different country , In my country , people usually go to travel as a group which led by a tour guide , because it is much more cheaper and they wants to go with their friend or family .
In my point of view , I think we still can travel to other country by ourself .
On that condition , you can do whatever you want and to able enjoy the trip .

Firstly , the country that you pick to travel which probably is the country that you wants to go the most uring that time .
Usually , if you go with your friend or family , you need to take care about them , you need to discuss where to go before getting out of the hotel .
During the discussion , you might have different opinion with others .
So , the advantage of the going alone is you can do want you want and go to the place that you wants .
It is very good that you do n't have to disscuss with other and you can arrange your own time .

Secondly , most of the people wants to have a relaxing and confortable trip during their travel .
They probably do n't want to miss out some special place or food in that country .
Also , they usually want to have good memory if they are really enjoy to visit the country and might go there once again .
Since going with a group of people , you might feel very innoying , usually , if it is led by a tour guide , the time is very limited , you go to the place and then you need to go to another place as soon as possible .
After the whole trip is finish , you might feel that actually you didnt visit and know the country much .
Therfore , if you go alone , you might enjoy your trip and may be you can know some new friend .

In conclusion , some people might think that travel alone is kind of stupid , they just want to go with their friends and family .
During the trip , there is someone who are willing to talk with you .

"With the development of tourism industry all over the world , more and more people will choose to travel in their leisure time .
However , the first problem the tourists will be confronted with is whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or to travel alone .
While some people may appreciate the advantage of travelling in a group for its convenience and experieced guide , I tend to choose to travel alone .
The benefits of travelling alone are listed as follows : when you travel alone , you can meet new friends during the journey ; also , you can find that travelling is much more flexible than leading by a tour guide ; last , the price is lower when you travel on your own .

First in first , when you travel alone , chanced are that you will make new friends during your journey and thus share your experieces and knowledge about the destination , about the world and about the real life .
For example , once I travel alone in Beijing , the charming city in China , it so happened that when I was trying to climb up the Great Wall , a stranger lent me his hand and he helped me to finish climbing the wall .
After we reached the top , we were already good friends and communicated a lot on our tourist experience .
Up till today , he is still my best friend in my life and we keep in touch with each other by mail and share our journey .

The next point of travelling alone is its flexibility .
Just think , if I was led by a guide , I will be forced to leave or go to a place I do n't like very much and have to go when I really want to stay for more time .
While I travel alone , I can figure out my favorite places and to select the nearest routine to the destinations .
Whenever I want to stay for a while , I can just enjoy my time .
There is no restrictions for me to travel .

Last but not the least , I found that travelling alone can be much cheaper than travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
As we all know , every travel agency must make profit to support their business .
Thus , they may be overcharged on the payment .
However , if I travel alone , I can save money for the sake of my own .
For example , I can choose the cheapest hotel rather than the expensive one .
Also I can choose to travel by train rather by air , which means a lot more expenditure .

As the reasons mentiond above , I prefer to travel on my own , not in a group .
The opportunities of making new friends , the flexibility of my travelling time and the economic fee I have to pay for my trip are all the factors that contribute to the reason .

"Which way is better to travel , in a group led by a tour guide or travel without a guide ?
I think it depands on where you are traveling to .
If I will take a trip in a famous city with several wel-known gardens and lots of special products , I will choose a group led by tour guide .
It 's convenience to visite the city and travel around from garden to garden on the tour bus and the guide will give many details on the history of the gardens .
And the tickets will be cheaper than if i buy them seperately cause those tour guides always have group discount .
I might have to buy some products in some perticular tourist stores that the tour guide leeds me into , but I might also get into those stores and get fooled even without a tour guide .
Do n't laugh at me as that is the realy experience myself in Hangzhou .
I visited Hangzhou 2 months ago all alone .
But I took a taxi to Longjing Moutain where the famous villige producted green tea located and bought some tea in high price just like all tourists did in group .
As I would did so anyway , why should n't I join a tour group and travel easily there ?

If taking trovel to some places like tibet , I will go without a tour guide .
The purpose to such places is to experience how is the life of people there .
You will not really experience it if you are in a group .
The only way you can get into the local life is to travel with your bag on foot .
To live as you are one of the local people .
How can you really know the live there when a tour bus is waiting for you out of the gate and bunch of your group mates are talking about eveything the see around you ?

You can always travel in a better way .

"The argument at hand is whether we should travel in a group led by a tour guide .
I disagree with this statement .
In my opinion , travelling on one 's own is a better choice instead .
I can conveniently plan my schedule , use my budget more efficiently , and most importantly , learn about the history of the country that I visit .

Firstly , travelling alone means that I can have a flexible travel plan .
I can book my own air tickets , reserve my own hotel room , and decide when to visit places .
But when I am on my own , I do not have to worry about the needs of the others .
I can choose my time to buy a cheaper air ticket , and rent hotels that appeals to me most .
I also do not have to visit places that I am not interested in .

Secondly , I can use my budget more efficiently .
If I am to be led by a tour guide , I will have to pay .
The fee is usually very expensive and will account for a large part of my travel expenses .
And since the quality of the service provided by the tour guide is unreliable , I think it is a better idea to spend the money on the travel itself , instead of hiring a tour guide .
With more money , I can go to more scenic spots and attractions .
I can also afford to buy more souvenirs , and taste expensive cuisine .

Thirdly , I can fully explore the history of the country that I visit when I travel alone .
Tour guides only give superficial information about places , and they seldom tell us about the history .
All they care about catching the coach bus on time , and hurrying places after places .
When I travel alone , I can talk to the local people , and ask them about the local history .
This way , I can have a closer look on the historical background of the region , and learn more about its culture .

To conclude , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I prefer travelling alone .
I can plan my own schedule , utilise my budget more efficiently , and learn about the history of the country that I visit .

"`` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ''
According to this sentence I come up with many ideas , and I would like to say that I agree with this statement .

I have traveled in many countries , such as Japan , America , Canada , Australia and Korea .
Most of the times I visited other countries by a tour guide .
The best thing about a tour guide is that they have been there before , so they are very familiar with there .
They know all the best parts of those countries , so they will show us in a order time .

In addition , a tour guide will book everything for you , for example , hotel , restaurant , parks , buses ...
They know all the times !
For example , when has a big event or show , when the parks are open , when the restaurants close , and where the places the visitors have to go during what time .
They also know which hotel is cheaper , but still nice enough to let us sleep comfortable , so we wo n't have to worry about where we are going to sleep tonight .
Furthermore , they will tell you how to get to the place you want to go , and tell you what you should buy down there because it 's cheap and can help you to keep memories .
They also will tell you what kinds of restarants are around here , and which one is famous , so you do n't need to waste a lot of time on thinking what you should have for dinner .

However , because you are in a group , so if someone is late , you have to wait until all the people in your group together ; on the other hand , you wo n't spend too much time in one place because you do n't have much time and they still have many places they are going to show you .

In conclusion , I think travel in a group led by a tour guide is a great thing if you do n't want to book everything by yourself .
It is also a good thing if you do n't know how to drive or never been to there before because someone familiar with there will show you around so you do n't need to worry about it .

"It 's the travel time , do you prefer travel alone or with a group led by a tour guide ?
A good question , I would not hesitate to go with a group led by a tour guide .

There are too many advantages to travel with the group led by a tours guide .
First , the efficiency issue .
We are busying on studying , working or anyother things , or you even can not imagine how we can spare ten or more minutes to google all the travel information and accomadation .
Preparation of travel is a time-consuming process , and it may get you stressed out when there 's no hotel room or air ticket available on a particular day .
If it 's with a group led by a tour guide , no worries , they arrange every single detail for you in advance .
So they reduce your effort and save your energy .

Second , the safety issue .
If we travel alone , we may choose driving for sightseeing among nearby place .
As we know , people are fatigue when they travel around , in the meantime , their focus on driving is distracted by views or landscapes outside of the car window .
Car accident probability during travel time ranks the top among other accidents situation according to our national survey .
I was involved in the exactly same situation once when I drived with my boyfriend , that 's a nightmare , you may never want to experience .

Third , the travel perception issue .
It 's no doubt that tour guides are real experts for explaination of tour sites .
As we may experienced , you are more exposed to the thorough information about specific place than you travel alone .
In addition , the tour guides are more informed about regulations or price change for relative sighseeing issue , therefore we can avoid some useless rush .
That 's why the tourist industry keep booming these years in our city for these 4 consecutive years .

Nevertheless , we embrace all intrinsic advantages of traveling with group led by tour guide , we may still have some pity for its inconvenience and comfortable concern .
We are not allowed to go wherever we feel like to go since it 's hard for tour guide to organize a huge group , we follow tour guide 's preference other than our owns .
Also , sitting in a tour bus with 40 people interrupted by any of their snoring or other noise seems not as enjoyable as driving my own car with my friends .

Even so , I still would jump up to choose travel with a group led by a tour guide if I were given a chance to select comparing with travel alone , and it 's obvious advantages outweigh its shortcomings , Travel with the group led by a tour guide can also foster our networking opportunity during the trip and may learn across culture .
What a good chance to know people beyond the above attractive conditions !

"In my opinion , travelling is a process for people to broaden their views fo world , to learn and share with others ' culture and to adjust their mind and body into a harmonic way .
And this whole process for travelling is neither necessarily in group nor led by the tour guide .

First of all , with the fast-pace improvement of information technology , one can go on the internet and search for any detailed information for any area .
There is not so many needs for a guide to tell you what the history and riddles of the scene are , instead we can easily find those information we want on the internet .

Secondly , the guided group are more likely to have a schedule on when and what to travel .
This is obviously against the nature of the travel , we need more time to talk to people and share the wisdom of life , which seems a tough and even impossible task for the tour guide , since to some extent , they had to follow the simple principle , time is money .
If we travelled by ourself , we can arrange our time freely , if there is a point of intersest that attract you a lot , we can reschedule it to go back one day later or even more .

Thirdly , we can know where our money spend when travelling by ourself , there is no way that you know the same thing when you give the money to the tour guide .
It sometimes ruins my mood of travelling by suspecting that the guide may keep some of our money to his own pocket .
Also , some guide may pull you to some restaurants or local shops that are not attractive to us at all , which in return the restaurants and shops give bonus back to the guide .
To me myself , I will feel cheated under such circumstance .

In summary , I am against the statement in the question .

"Travelling is one of the most exiting things in the world .
However , it is not possible to travel everyday in one 's entire life because of both time and money constrains .
Therefore , in one of the rare occations that a person travels , it is important to plan the trip in the most enjoyable way .
While some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , I prefer to travel alone or with only family members or friends .
Below , I will discuss the reasons behind my preference .

It is true that when you go to a new city or country , you need someone to take you around an show you what famous sceneries are in the city .
However , these may not be the places that I would want to look at .
Everyone is so unique in the world , so everyone has different interest .
What the tour guide shows me may represent the preferenc of the majority , but it may not be my preference .
Therefore , when I travel , I would prefer to do my own research on the city , so that I will know what I like about the city or country and go visit these interested places .
Moreover , this way can make me know the visited city more .

On top of the different interests people may have , travelling time is another problem that may arise when you are travelling with a group led by a tour guide .
It is simple to illustrate this point .
To a tour guide , it is a job to take you around the city , so he will only work during his working hour which is usually from 8 am to 5 pm .
However , to me , travelling is one of the rare treats that I have , so I would like to make it as enjoyable and long as possible .
I would not like to go back to the hotel at 5 o'clock and go to bed .
Instead , I would like to explore how the city is like at night or after the tour guide 's working hour , but I cannot just ask the tour guide to work overtime .

Besides different interests among people and difficult scheduling of travel time , privacy is another main reasons that I would like to travel without a tour guide .
In some occations , travelling is a chance to spend some private time with partner , family , or friends .
Therefore , it is not always comfortable to travel with a tour guide .

Travelling is such a nice treat to any one , so making it interesting , flexable in scheduling and private is crucial .
Therefore , I would prefer not to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
",P6,CHI,high,0
"I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I think the trip will be well-planned , enjoyable , and economical in this way .

A tour guide usually knows the resort well .
Therefore , he or she most likely has a good plan of where to visit , where to eat , where to take pictures , and where to stay for the nights .
I went to the Niagara Falls in a group led by a tour guide .
The guide talked about the history and formation of the Falls on the bus .
We stopped at a small and good restaurant for lunch .
In the afternoon , he took us directly to the best spots of views .
I did not spent any time looking up a map and figuring out where to go .

It is enjoyable to travel with a group led by a tour guide .
We can talk on the way .
We can also make friends with each other .
We can help each other when needed .
When I went to the Smoky Mountain last summer , we were talking and singing on the bus .
It was one of the best memories of my vacation .

It is also economical to travel with a group led by a tour guide .
People can share the expenses of renting a bus or a car .
They can share the expenses on gas and tolls as well .
Sometimes it is cheaper to buy bulk tickets than to buy each ticket individually .
For example , if a ticket costs twenty dollars for one , it might only cost fifteen dollars each if you buy ten of them at the same time .

These are the reasons why I think it is a good idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
",P6,CHI,high,0
"Yes , I believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Tour guides are often more experienced and more familiar with the place of travel and they can show us the speciality about that place .

Travelling in a group alone or with friends in a foreign country without a tour guide is like getting lost in a maze .
We wouldn not know how to communicate with local people , how to buy things and even get the food we want .
Also , it might be hard to travel to the landmarks without understanding the way transportation works in that particular country .
On the other hand , if we have a tour guide with us , he would probably have some connections with the travel agencies and it would be easier to communicate with local people and also bring us to the local attractions that we want to see without any problems .

Tour guides are meant to be hired for people travelling in foreign countries and need a person to guide or lead them .
Tour guides are professionally trained and experienced with the country they are guiding in .
They are often from that particular country and they know how to speak the local language and they understand how things work , so that you would feel more comfortable and would trust them as being your leader .

Although you might not get to do certain things that you had in mind , when travelling in a group with a tour guide , you would definitely have a great time and it would be the best , and the safest way to travel .
With a tour guide , you get to experience or see the local life styles , local food , and local attractions , much more easier than travelling by yourself blindly , not knowing where exactly you are yourself .
In conclusion , in my opinion , the best way to travel is indeed in a group led by a tour guide as you get to experience a wider range or varieties of sight-seeing places without getting lost and to experience different sorts of local culture .
",P6,CHI,high,0
"I disagree with the statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In this essay I will state the reasons why I am against this idea .

More often than not , people choose to travel in a goup led by a tour guide because they are either not familiar with the place where they are trvaeling or not familiar with the langauage .
Therefore , they are afraid of having trouble and have no way to ask for help .
With the advanced technology , it cannot be easier to find information about the place you plan to visit .
You can book air tickets and hotels and rent cars online .
You can download maps of the cities you are visiting and carry them with you so that you are less likely to get lost .
As for the language problem , with more and more people traveling around the world , local people more or less learn to speak several languages relating to their main sources of tourism .
Moreover , how much language will be required to travel a place ?
Not much , I think .
When you are doing sightseeing , you do not talk .
When you are shopping , you just need to know the price and you just simply look at price tags .
When you are ordering food , you just need to know what is on the menu .
Even though you cannot read , there are always pictures .

I prefer to travel with friends without a tour guide .
I enjoy more freedom by doing so .
There is no tight schedule to meet .
Plans are always flexible .
Most important of all , I am not always in a rush .
I can stay in a place as long as I wish .
By traveling alone or with friends , I have more opportunities to experience local culture and to observe the way local people live .
I am not in a hurry to run from this place to another .
When I find something interesting , I can stay longer to find out more .
This in turn contributes more to my memory than just storming from place to place taking pictures .

To sum up , traveling by oneself not with a group benefits travelers more .
Even though there might be more preparation work to do before setting out , you learn and gain more after coming back from the trip .
In my points of view , people learn to be independent by traveling alone to a foreign country .
Taking myself as an example , I always travels alone and I find myself grow up a bit after every trip .

"When travelling in a group led by a tour guide , one person will feel convenient because the tour guide will arrange the routine and lodging , and can share happiness with different people in the group .
However , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Firstly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will waste a lot of time on waiting for other people .
I once had a trip in a group of 20 people .
Before visiting a place , everyone was told to come back in one hour .
I came back on time but stayed there for half hour just to wait for those who did n't return punctually .
As a result , we had no time to visited another place which interested me .

Secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will based upon a fixed routine .
The routine is arranged not according to the tourists ' interests , but according to the purpose of the travelling agent firm .
So during the travelling , we will lose chances to explore new sites and routines , which are more attractive .

Thirdly , travelling in a group led by a wrong tour guide will be a nightmare .
If the tour guide just cares about money , he will always lead the tourists to some shops where the prices are extremely high .
In this way , a lot of time will be wasted and a lot of money will be spent on the commodities which do not worth that much .
On the other hand , the guide will earn commissions from the retailors by taking the tourists into the shops .
For example , last year my friend spent USD 100 on a necklace on a travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
But the same necklage can be bought at a price of USD 25 in another place .
",P6,CHI,high,0
"I do not agree the statement .
Travelling in a group led by a guide may seem to make your trip more comfortable , as the whole intinery has been planned for you .
You only need to follow the lead and ` woo and wow ' over the spectacular sights .
But this may lose the whole point of travelling to a foreign country in the first place : You want to enjoy yourself in a place that you have never been before , therefore you travel .

The first thing that you will miss out when travelling in a group tour is the planning of your own trip .
You may be forced to go to places that you are not interested in , or even threatened to shop in a particular place .
As happened recently in Hong Kong , a Mainland China tour group was abandoned by their tour guide because they were not willing to buy anything from a designated shop .
This may only be an extreme case , but you cannot deny that you will only be able to see the famous tourist sights and nothing more if you go on a tour .
Yet , if you go on your own , you can go to all sorts of bizarre places that you may want to go , and not have to crowd with all the other tourists in the so-called ' tourist spots ' , which may not be appealing to you at all .

Some people may be afraid to get lost if they go to a totally strange place on their own .
But I say that is part of the thrill and fun of travelling to a foreign place .
You could find your own way out , and maybe find an exciting place that you did n't even know about before .
Or you could always ask the locals for directions , possibly developing a friendship with them .
Travelling on your own allows you to have more interaction with the place and the people .
When I travelled to Thailand on my own , while tourists were eating bland food in a ` high-end restaurant ' , I was eating delicious local food andchatting away happily with the locals at one of the market stalls .
Language is not a problem ; you will learn how to communicate fluently in a mix of oral and body languages in no time .
See ?
Another benefit of travelling on your own .

On the whole , the main point of travelling is to seek pleasure in a place beyond your own home .
If you cannot fully experience the place , then why waste money and time to go on a trip ?

"I do not agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
And I prefer for travel alone even though I will face many unknown problems because I think it will save my time and I will go to anywhere I want to without limitation .

Many people have a traditional idea that they must be in a group led by a tour guide when they travel .
But I think it is incorrect since it will waste your time .
Whenever you move to a new place , you must follow the tour guide 's step and can not control your time by yourself .
What you should do is waiting all the time even though you have been exhausted .
Waiting for other people who belong to your group to prepare , and waiting for the tour guide 's tedious introduction of some famous buliding or carve which you are of interested of at all .
Eventually time is up , and you have not do what you are desired to except hearing the words `` Because of no time , let us go back '' by your tour guide .

The second thing is that you can go to any places you are interested in if you travel alone .
Without the tour guide you can go to the museum or theare which may not be included in the schecule of a group led by a tour guide .
You can go the shopping mall to buy whatever things you like instead of lining on the traveling group to shop in a mall which is the tour guide 's recommendation .
Finally you can alos have food in the restraunts where serve you well and make you feel gorgeous .

So above are my reasons that traveling by yourself can get lots of benefits .
If I you make a decision to travel abroad and want to have a good time , try to do it by yourself .

"It is true that people lead busy lives in nowadays ; therefore some people prefer a organized trip with a tour guide .
It is also ture that travel in a group will reduce numerous troubles .
But for me , it is hardly true that travel in a group led by a tour guide is my first option .

I would like to plan my own trip and explore the new world by myself .
Among the diverse benefits a self-planed trip will bring are more free of time , cheaper , and deeper understanding .

Travel alone will reduce the costs .
It is deniable that the travel agency will make money through the travel .
You are not aware of the exact or true costs of your flights , transportation or lodging fees .

Though some of the agency will provide costums a detailed list of the expenditure ; however , it is hard for costums to find out whether it is true .
Also in most cases in China , the tour guide will lead you to some specific stores to buy unuseful products , through which the guide will get some melon-cutting .

Plan your own trip will make you more free of time .
In a group , we always find that people share differenct interests .
While some of the travelers intend to spend more time on this site , others complain that it is boring and insist leaving immediately .
How to solve this problem ?
The only choice is to obey the majority with the sacrifice of your own interests .
On the contrary , if you plan a trip by your self , you can totally free .
You can decide where to go , how to allocate the time in every sites or ...

Go for a travel of your own plan will make you understand more about the new places .
For example , after having made the decision to visit Britain in grade 12 , I did a lot of survey of myself .
I had to look up relevant information on the internet to familiar with it relics and historical sites .
Though I had heard a lot about the London Tower and British Museum , I was still in its appearance .
Through the investigation , I leart the history of the London Tower and the story behind .
I also planed my route by chechking every places I wanted to go .
In this way , I tasted the pleasure and excitement of travel before I really started .
You will probably ask how is your trip ?
Counld not be better .
Because already known the sites before you visited , when you came to the site , you would feel the echo from the history and make you distinguished from other tourists , thoes who simply went there and then took a photo .

Nonetheless , I am not aguing that a travel in group lead by tour guide is very bad .
It is also have it own benefies , since everything is a two-edged sword in the world .
But when you ask me which one do I prefer , I will tell you without hesitation that plan and travel on yourself is my better choice which makes me save money , be free of time and understand more .
At last I want to say travel is anything other than unerstand more , by `` more '' I mean to explore by yourself .

"As far as I am concerned , I am not agree with the statement at all that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are many reasons that I do not like the group led travel , and I will just explore the most important ones here .

The first reason I want to bring forward is that travel in a group led by a tour guide is so limited , not only the space but also the time .
Usually , the trace of this kind of travel has been planed before the travel begins .
So you just take a limited glance at some places you want to visit , which just decided by the tour guide .
There are always more places that will atractive your eyes beyond the tour guide 's thought .
Another aspcct is about the time .
It seems unwise not the follow the tour guide as near as possible , or you will fall behind .
Because the time of the travel depond on the tour guide instead of you .

Another reason , which is also commonly considered , is that the travel in agroup led by a tour guide is always in the holiday .
For some aspect , it is not bad .
However , travel in the holiday will cause many problems .
It is obviously that the tour places are rather crowed during the holidays .
If you want to take the group led travel , you just can avoid the unpleasant situation .
What is more , as a result of the rush of the holiday travel , many accidents are easily to take places .

In addition , travel in a group led by a tour guide is not a good idea for family travel .
In the modern society , people pay more attention to the time spent with family menbers .
If you choose to travel with your family indepedently , you will find it is much easier to enjoy the life along with the travel .

For the reasons above , it is surely that I will travel without the tour guide .
It is just realize the mean of the travel ---- for fun and pleasure .

"Some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , but some of the others prefer to travel alone or with a couple of partners .
In my opinion , I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are three reasons based on my experience convince me that the best way to travel is alone or with partners .

First of all , self-organized travels maintains personal preferences on routes .
It would be dipressed that some places one wishes to visit are not on the tour list .
To travel alone hat the benefit of choosing whatever one likes and whereever one wants to go .
For me , traveling is a self discovering adventure .
Without the freedom to make decisions during the travel is lack of the meanings of traveling its own .

Secondly , i prefer to organize a tour on ones own because one would learn more and get the most of the period of time .
From collecting informations of the destination and researching the cultural differences , one abtaines so much more knowledge along with the planning .
Furthermore , planning the schedule would help one to get the basic knowledge of the trip .
On the contrary , in a group led by a tour guide limits the possibility to explore interresting facts of different cultures and also limits people 's incentives to get more to know about the backgroud of the place .

Thirdly , the flexible schedule makes travels more enjoyable .
Everyone who had followed a tour trip had had such experience of rushing to follow the schedule .
Self-organized travel is flexible that one can make decisions based on the weather , health conditions , or even mood .
For example , if one gets too tired from yesterdays schedule , one can just sleep more until the the energy gets back .
Flexible schedule not only adjust the personal condition better , but also brings out unexpected surprises during the trip , which is one the most wonderful part of traveling .
For example , five minute late for the bus might lead one to another route , but the other way which less traveled by might be more beautiful than the original plan .

In conclusion , there are so much more fun to travel alone or with a couple of partners rather than following the fixed schedules .
In my opinion , the most momorial moments in a travel are those which i did not expect .

"I have traveled many places throughout my life .
I love to travel with my parents , but of course , there were many times that we traveled in a group led by a tour guide .
I personally prefer to travel without a group and definately to travel without a tour guide .

The first summer vacation that my parents and I went to Japan , I was only six years old .
We were with a group of people , and there was a tour guide .
Every historical place or any amusement park we went , we traveled with a big tour bus .
The tour guide would then explained details for information that tourists should know .
Though it seemed to be useful , I felt most of the time I was `` trapped , '' and `` bored . ''
And I wanted to see this very phenomenal temple on our way to the hotel , but I was told not to do so because we were on the group ; it was not on the schedule .
I felt it was such a disappointment .
In addition , I could not have stay in a place where I wanted to stay longer ; daily schedule was already written for us , and the place we went might not be the one I was interested in .

I have travled to Hong Kong , United States , Korea , and Japan alone or with my parents .
It was such a big difference compare to if I was with a group .
I could do everything I wanted .
I was free to stop by a comestic shop whenever I felt like it .
My time was flexible .
It was the best when I acutally went to Korea and stayed with my friends ' houses .
They brought me to places that I do n't think I would go if I was with a group .
For instance , my friend 's grandparents garden and places where famous band concerts performed .
It was incredibly entertaining and that is why I am passionate about traveling without a group led by a tour guide .

Though there are reasons I partly liked to travel in a group led by a tour guide , I do not think that is the best way to travel .
I am more comfortable either traveling alone or with my parents because it not only benefits the relationship between me and my family , I also see the world larger in this point of view .

"I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In out real life , although we often travel with a tour guide , it is more fun to discover the excitment covered by the mask of the place you visit all by yourself .
Some of you might say that it is more fun to travel with a tour since you are not familiar with the place you are going to , but what I think is that traveling with a tour actually does n't give you more information about the local buildings or spot you are visiting than just travel by yourself .
If a finalized , perfect travel has to be accomplished , one has to collect all the information one needs and starts the unmasking discovery adventure not just paying lots of money and have to waiting for the buses in the morning and later found out that someone has troubles with the payment and the schedule is delayed .
Traveling with a guide tour usually has no personal space during the schedule .
Going with people scrambling together cannot genrantee your individual actions might be appropriate to others .
You might want to do some break dances during the break or listen to the music loudly , but there is always someone in your group might disagree with your actions .
You might experience peacefulness while you are along , and so does traveling .
If you travel with a group , you might have to endure the noise surrounding you since there are people talking or doing their personal stuff that you probably would explode and start complaining ; on the other hand , if you travel along , the problem does not exist anymore .
Accidents has more chances to happen between people than a person along , according our history that mobs are usually the headache of the government and accidents happen more frequently within the unstable group .
So if one traveled along , he might get a happy trip after the day off , but if one traveled with a group led by a tour guide , there absolutely will be accidents such as people missing , people fighting , or someone falls into the water and break his leg .
The last benefit provided by traveling along is no time restriction .
Since it is all by your own , you are the tour guide , it is you who decided where the trip is taking place and how the trip is going to be .
Traveling along has more benefits than traveling with a group of people led by a tour guide .

"No one can escape the absorbing experience offered by traveling .
There are lots of ways for people to travel around , such as traveling in a group or going on one 's own .
Some people may like to travel on their own ; however , as far as I am concerned , not only obtaining better information about the places one vist can a travel in a group offers , but it will allow people know more friends .

First , the more likely one visits a place with a group , the more information he will konw as to this places , the better he will enjoy his journey .
To acquire a full appreciation of what this means , we can turn to a common example .
When a girl travals to Beijing , the capital of China , she will want to know the backgrouds of Beijing as much as possible .
If she joins a group , she can ask the guide and then she will be acquainted with , for example , the history , the culture , the food and even the economy of Beijing .
In addition , when she goes to the well-known place-The Great Wall , she also can enjoy so many funny stories about this place form the guide .
Obviously , it is the guide that can permit a colorful trip .

What is more , traveling with many people can also provide a potential function , that is , one can make more friends .
For instance , in a trip to America , a chinese girl may share a lot of time with a boy from Japan .
During the precious time , they will talk a lot concerning the beautiful sceneries they visit , and moreover they can communicate with each other about their own countries .
After the journey , they may become good friends .
In addition , with a group , one also can receive help easily when he encounters some troubles , including diseases .

However , there are still other people who will maintian the advantages of traveling alone .
The reason given by them reats on a belief that they will safe more time when a group of people discuss where to visit .
Towards this opinion , I must say they will regret when facing difficulties which they could not handle by themselves .

From what has been discussed above , a concrete conclusion can been drawn that although much more time will be saved when traveling on one 's own , when it comes to better understanding the places one visit and more friends to enjoy the journey together , traveling in a group will carry more weight .
With so mand benefits , why should n't people travel with a group ?

"I have travelled abroad for more than five times .
Half of the travels I made was with a tour guide , while the other half did n't .
I have to admit that traveling with a tour guide in a group is really a easier way to travel .
Everything is planned by the tour guide .
You do n't need to worry about where to stay in the next stop , how to get the next destination .
However , if I have time to make travel plans in advance , I prefer travel on my own .

I can take my time to enjoy the journey more when traveling alone than with a tour group .
I like going to museums , seeing art displays and savoring the exotic cuisines .
I can keep my own pace in the journey and really have a good look at the cities .
The travel plans made by the travel agencies are often too packed for me .
I do n't like to be in a hurry .

The other thing that I like to travel alone is that I do n't need to put up with other people in a tour group .
Sometimes I mett members in the tour group that really have bad habits .
For example , I 've been in a tour group , and one of the members in the group was often late for the scheduled time .
As a result , the whole group had to postpone our next schedule just because of his lateness .

Compared with traveIing in a group with a tour guide , I enjoy traveling by myself more .
In this way , I can really see what I want to see and I do n't have to face the inconveniences caused by some members in the tour group .

"As the development of transportation , people travel more .
The most common way of travelling is like this : going to a travel agency , flying to a place with a group people , listening what the tour guide said and flying back .
I do n't , however , admire this `` common way '' and never consider it the best way of travelling .

The biggest problem brought by having a tour guide is the absence of freedom .
You have to go to one place after another exactly as the fixed plan .
The schedule was full of different arrangements and you could rarely get the chance of walking around alone in such circumstances .
For instance , I once went to Hong Kong on my own while a friend of mine went there with a group of people and a tour guide .
As soon as she met me in Hong Kong , she started to complain about her trip .
She said that she could n't go to the place she really wanted , eat food she liked , and even the shops she loved .
All she did was taking buses to different places and walking around as a walking machine .
She was very upset about her trip and did n't find any pleasure in it .

Another nightmare brought by group touring is shopping -- a group of tourists are often brought into a shop by the tour guide and forced to buy products .
This is quite true in some coutries according to my own experience .
Since guides could get money from the shops , you may be badly treated by the tour guide if you did n't buy anything .
Nobody could have a nice trip in such cases , is n't it ?

For me , I prefer going to places myself , without a tour guide or other unknown people .
When I travelled to Hong Kong , I only booked my plane tickets and hotel , for a cheaper price , by travel agency .
My travel is like this : I walked in the streets of Hong Kong , went to those small local shops that a tour guide would never introduce to you , eat those really `` Hong Kong '' food that you may never eaten in a big restaurant , and talked with local people about their daily life .
These are things you could never have when attending a group and led by a guide .
Leading by a guide is an experience of `` viewing and listening '' , but not travelling ; only when you walked in a city or a place of interest on your own , can you find its charm and fall in love with travelling .

"When people talk about traveling , most people will want to join a group which will be led by a tour guide .
I always ponder on the reason why they make such an ignorant decision .
With a tour guide , one can hardly have enough time to appreciate the traveling , with a tour guid , one can no longer be free , and with a tour guid , one has to pay .

In my life , my first travel was to New York and i thought of it as a horrible trip , because i was basically like a robot which was controlled by the tour guide .
Even buying a icecream across the street needed his permission .
I knew that he did n't want any of his client be lost , but i was totally restrained under his rule .
I no longer felt that i was on a trip which i was supposed to enjoy .

The first monument that i visited was the Liberal Bell which was protected by some special glasses .
With that godlike tour guide , i can hardly read any information on this bell .
Before having read about its derivation , i was `` told '' to leave , because the bus was leaving .
If i did n't have that tour i would have learned so much about this wonderful bell whille enjoying the trip .

When we arrived at the Hotel which we were going to sleepover tonight , i was `` told '' not to leave the hotel .
I felt that i was restained in this `` jail '' .
It was so absurd to me that i was not free on my own trip .
It was not that i could not speak english and would have language barrier between the people .
With this limit freedom , i could barely do anything .

When i reached the end of this `` wonderful '' trip , i needed to pay this guide who spoiled my trip money .
The whole concept of having a tour guide is ridiculous .

People may feel unsecured without having a guide but that 's part of our life .
Nobody goes to a strange place and immediately , he knows everything .
Trip without a tour guide is a true vacation .
One can freely walk on the street to view the wonderful city , New York .
One can interact with the people on the street without any worry of time limit , and one can truely enjoy one 's vacation .

"In people 's life , they need a guide who can lead them to the right way and the also need sorrounders ' help while they do everyting brand new .
Otherwise people might be lost their way or go to an incorrect direction .
Therefore , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
When people tralvel in a group they can help each other and make the trip safely .
Led by a tour guide is also important because people will go to the right direction and they wo n't get lost .

While people chose how to travel , they will chose travel in a group .
So do i. Several years ago when i was in grade 6 , i wanted to have a trip and because of my parents are very busy so they can not take me to travel .
They did n't allow me to travel alone .
I was extremely disappointed and did n't eat for a whole day .
My parent 's felt awful .
Then , they came up with an idea which was took me to the travelling center , and the travelling center would have a group trip just for students .
So i joined the group and i had a wonderful trip .
I thing my parents took me to travel in a group because it was safe and these `` cute '' guys would help each other when they have difficulties .
All in all , travel in a group is safe and people can help each other .

Even though travel in a group is safe , people can still lost their ways because they do n't know where to go in a brand new place .
They may go to incorrect directions or stay at one place for a long time .
These well loss lots of time and time is our life .
And these may make people in trable and in danger .
Therefore , we need a tour guide to led the travelling group to go to the correct way and leave the `` trables '' alone so that it will be much more safe and save our time .

In conclusion , if people want to have a safety and fantastic trip , travel in a group led by a tour guide is very important because we do n't want hanppiness and trables beside us .

"As a student myself , the question of whether it is necessary to acquire the knowledge or to merely learn the fact about it has been pounding quite often through my experience of learning .
Obviously , it takes far more time and efforts to entirely understand the knowledge whereas sometimes it is mandatory for students to roughly learn the facts according to the requirement of their curriculum .
In my opinion , I completely agree with the point of view in the statement that it is far more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts .

First of all , to be able to understand the ideas is to master the knowledge , which requires students to be quite familiar with the fields of knowledge where a great deal of researches have to be done before one could reach such level of understanding .
Through the way of reseaching , students can not only learn the history and origin of such concepts but also gain a deep impression of the knowledge itself .
The knowledge that is totally understood will last a long time and thus becomes the life-time fortune for students .

Secondly , a rough knowledge of facts would n't help students to learn further .
Some education systems ask their students to remember a certain facts on the textbook as a way to learn knowledge .
In this way , students might pass their exams with impressive marks by staying up late to cram through the textbook but there would n't be much knowledge left for them after the test , which to many of them is a massive loss as well as a waste of efforts .
If students have a better understanding of the knowledge , they are able to apply their knowledge to real life and solve problems easily .

Last but not the least , having a good understanding of ideas and knowledges inspires students to go further beyond .
It helps the students to foster a great interest of the knowledge and drives them to `` dig a deeper hole '' .
`` Interests is the best teacher . ''
The mission of learning is to carry on the experience and wisdom of the past and walk farther in civilization .
The inspiration students gain from their understanding of ideas and concepts helps to broaden their horizons , to see the world in a multi-dimension perspect , and eventually to foster noble values and beliefs .

Learning , as we all know , is a life-time experience .
Therefore , it is quite crusial to find the best way to learn .

"I disagree with this statement .
To my consideration , learning facts is of greater importance than simply understanding ideas .
I 'll illustrate this point in the following three aspects .

First , ` understanding ' ideas without learning facts does n't mean people FULLY understand these ideas .
Only through connection to facts , could the students know where these idea came from , and how they formed .
For example , In our childhood , we all learn from teachers that there are 9 planets surrounding the sun .
But recently , scientists expelled Plato out of the solar system .
And now , technically speaking , there are only 8 planet left .
Plato did n't change .
What changed is our criteria of planets .
If students do n't understand the criteria , by simply remembering the structure of solar syustem will not help to understand the essence of solar system .

Second , students may find it hard to implement theories into practice in this way .
Theory without practical outcome is of little use for people in their daily life .
By understanding ideas in the textbooks , students could score high in the exam .
But it could not benefit them when they graduate from school , and when they need to start to implement these ideas into their work , because they did n't learn the facts that these ideas are based on .
This kind of student wo n't be competent in modern society .

Third , there 's always some facts that could not be explained by simply illustrating ideas .
If a student is obssessed with understanding ideas too much , he might not be curious about numerous facts that could not be explained by these ideas .
Curiosity is what keeps innovation happens .
Fueled with it , a great amount of future innovation will take place .
For example , UFO is still inexplainable by current scientific theories .
However , a student may get interested in it by learning facts that this phenomenon could not be explained by scientific ideas .
The next great astronaut after Amstrong might probably starts here .

In conclusion , learning facts is important in truly understanding scientific ideas , implementing theories , and keeping curiosity to spark innovation .
This is more important to students .

"I most certainly agree with this statement .
As a music teacher myself , of course I want my students to learn their facts , but it is more important for them to understand it .
I believe that a student should be able to understand what they just learned because that is why we learn in school .
We go to school to learn and understand the materials to apply it to our lives .
If a student did not understand something , then they are not going to be able to use it in life .

The best way of knowing what they have been taught is asking them to use it .
If they can not use what they had learned , then that means they do not understand that certain topic .
It is absolutely pointless for a student to go to class and just memorize facts .
To understand something means you can use it , teach it to someone , and be able to go further than just '' memorizing '' the facts .
To me , in order for any student to excell is for them to be able to use what they know .

I am not saying that learning facts are not important for a student , but sometimes there is no point in teaching that topic to the student if it means they do n't know what just happened .
A student can walk in a class and ` learn the facts ' , but that student will come back out with only facts .

For example , there is a math student who just learned all the numbers of a problem .
Sure , he knows all the numbers , but how in the world the numbers got to where they are is a completely different matter for the student .
That is why teachers today take time to pull things apart and explain them in details .
This situation can happen in any class .
Poetry can be read and the students can read it and learn the vocabulary to only read a poem .
Although to go through the details of the poem would be much more effective in a student 's literature skills .

I do not agree that facts is all we should learn about in life .
There is much more to learning than just facts and statistics .
Being able to truly understand what was taught is the same as saying , `` okay , I know how to use it now and it definitely makes more sense than just memorizing notes . ''

As far as I concerned with the topic stated above , I wo n't agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and comcepts than it is for them to learn facts .

The reasons go as follows :
To begin with , as we all know the ideas and concepts are usually more abstract than the facts .
It is more difficult for the students to understand at the beginning .
If the students can know the facts first and then relate the facts to the theories , it is easier for them to understand deeply .
It is always the case in the study fields such as economics , maths , physics .
Perhaps everyone may have the experience that the professors will explain the theory of movement in the physics lesson by telling the facts at the very beginning .

Secondly , when we think deeply , we will ask ourselves : what are the ideas and concepts serving for ?
Of cause it is served to apply to the daily life , or more accurate , we use it to explain the facts .
So how can we know the concepts without knowing the facts ?
For instance , students know the idea of the transportation of the electonic but they do n't know about the facts that this theory is applied to make the telephone , what 's the purpose of knowing the theory concept .
The ideas and concepts become more valuable only when they apply to our daily life and improve our life quality .

Last but not the least , the ideas and concepts today may not be correct just like the theory of nature seletion and evolution were not true long time ago .
So the students need to know the facts and compare the facts with the idea in order to verify and make sure if it go with each other .
It is also very important for a student to challenge the existing ideas using the facts they know .

In a word , I think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts at the same time .

"The issue in hand is about the ideas and concept understaing or facts learing .
This issue is improtant because it can diectly affect the result of what the student learns .
I believe that the understandinf of the ideas and concepts is the better opinion since it can make it easlier for students to learn .

The first reason that I choose understanding of the ideas nad concepts because it is the easiler way of memory .
Unike remebering the facts , the uderstanding of the ideas and concepts is a lot easlier to transfer into long term memory .
Thus , it is able for student to remeber much longer .
Base on the easlier way of memory , I believe that the understanding of the ideas and concepts is a better opinion than the other .

The stable foundation of the studies is the second reason that i choosse the understanding of ideas and concepts .
A deep understanding of the idea and concepts is similar to a building which has a stable foundation .
Only and only if the foundation of the building is strong enough , it is able to build up higher and higher .
Since the stable foundation of the studies , the understanding of ideas and concpets is better choice .

Finally , the abilities of flexible use make me choose the understanding of the ideas and concepts rather than the other .
The remebering the facts is just a remembering , it will not allow to create something new .
However , unlike the remembering facts , a deep understanding of ideas and concepts not only allows the students to create something new , but also provide the abilities to use it in any area .
Thus , I belieive that the understanding of the ideas and concepts is a better opinion .

In conclusion , I believe that the understanding of the ideas and concepts is a better opinion rather than the other .
It is because of the easlier way of memory , the stable foundation of the studies and the abilities of flexible use .

"I disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact .
There are several reasons to explain my point .
First of all , I believe that it is necessary for students to learn facts first , which will help them to grasp knowledge and make them get a sense of feeling of what they 've known about the world around them and help them to perceive their own ideas .
Ontology and epistomology are the basic elements for human beings to understand the world and the reality .
It is especially important for students to learn facts .

Secondly , I think it is equally important for students to understand ideas and concepts and learn facts .
As ideas and concepts are coming from the facts that leart , they are correlated with each other .
Students cannot fully grasp the ideas or concepts if they lack basic knowledge of facts , on the contrary , facts are meaningless if ideas and concepts could not be understood .
For instance , the idea that hungry cats will more porbably catch moving objectives like birds and mise than the ones that are full could be fully understood only if students got an idea that cats prefer mise and birds as their food , which is the common sense .

Thirdly , understanding facts will better enable students to grasp ideas and concepts and help them to put the idea and concepts into practice .
Take another example to illustrate this view , the fact that people will fail down easily on an icy road will help students better konw the ideas that it should be careful to walk on an icy road , and the experiment that erosion will decrease the possiblity of failing down and spliting salt water will increase the melting time of ice will make people carry these concepts out in reality so that the road will be much safer to walk on .

In short , it is in a rush to say that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than for them to learn facts .
From the analysis above , we may conclude that understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are interacting with each other and hold the idea of they are equally important will help us better understand the reality and the world around us .

"Learing is a complex process .
It includes understanding ideas , concepts , learing process , and getting the facts .
There are discussions about which is more important during the learing process .
I think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than just to know the facts .

As is known to all , during learning , we should not just care about the results , we should also care about the important ideas and concepts underlying the results .
We should make clear that we know how we can get the results , that 's how we can go through the understanding ideas , integrating concepts , and making derivarition to get the results .

Nowadays , because of the study competition , students care much about the grades they can get .
During study , sometimes , they just want to get the right answer without knowing why it comes to this not another .
Sometime , they even just memorize the results as to get the right marks in the test .
This is contradictory with the real goal of learing .
Facts are important , but the ideas and concepts we should learn through the process of getting facts are more important .
So the students should not just satisfied with the right facts , they had better pursue the right process through which we can get the right answer .

Learing prepare us the backgrounds , knowledge and technology for our future work .
This includes the ideas and concepts those are strongly confirmed .
The facts are just one kind of methods to help us understand ideas and conepts better .
The facts for different situations are different .
Even we know the right facts at this time , if we ca n't master the methods and technology gaining from the basic ideas and concepts which are used to get the facts , we wo n't get success in our future work .
In future practical conditions , everything is new , every problem is like a stranger to us .
We ca n't use the facts we memorized before to get the conclusion , we should try our best to use the ideas and concepts we have mastered to get the new conclusions .

"In the recent years , many educators , parents and students have discussed how the students learn more efficiently and effectively .
There are two different philosophy that has been proposed in this hot topic .
One is to understand ideas and concepts and another one is to learn facts .

Most western countries like United States and Canada , the teachers encourage the students to understand ideas and concepts first .
The teaching approach is not bound to the fact that the students do not urge to remember a lot of information and facts from the textbooks .
For example , the teachers try to use some daily examples to explain some concepts in science such as physics , chemistry and biology .
At the same time , the students can develop their own creative , innovative and troubleshooting ability .
Meanwhile , it is good for the students to be capable of brainstorming in this very competitive communities .

In the other hand , most eastern countries such as China , Japan and so , the teachers prefer to ask the students to remember a lot of facts and information so as to build up their fundamental basis on their study .
However , most of the students cannot advocate their interest in their study .
In addition , the students are not willing to accept more new concepts or they are not able to develop any novel ideas in their study .
For example , the students are good at memory , but not on any innovation or troubleshooting issues in their living either .
Thus , it is not an effective and flexible way for them to deal with the difficulties and hurdles that they really face in the reality .

To be concluded , I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
This approach would be more beneficial to the students in order to encounter and survive in this competitive world .

"Some people believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , while others believe that it is more important for students to learn facts .
I maintain the opinion that both the ability to understand ideas and concepts and the ability to learn facts are equally important in the study of a student .

The ability to understand ideas and concepts and the ability to learn facts are mutually benificial .
On the one hand , understanding ideas and concepts will help students to learn facts faster and better .
For example , if a student of psychology understands the concept of behavior modification , he/she will be able to learn the facts that associate with how a elimentary school child behaves in class and how this child changes his/her behaviors better and faster .
Also , it is unlikely that this psychology student will forget these facts once he/she understands this concept .
On the other hand , learning facts will provide students with evidences that support their understanding of ideas and concepts .
In other words , ideas and concepts will be supported by the facts that students learn .
For instance , a student of history will be more likely to understand the concept of Westward Movement when he/she remembers that conflicts between the white settlers and Indians , the spread of America 's land , and the social , political , and economic changes during that particular time period of history .

The ability to understand ideas and concepts and the ability to learn facts are mutually dependent .
A good student needs to both understand ideas and concepts and learn facts .
A student who can only understand ideas and concept without learning the facts will find the ideas and concepts dry and boring without being able to explain events in the real world .
The process of learning will thus become mechanical recitation of theories without knowing how they work in practical applications .
A student who can only learn facts will find himself/herself lost in the plethora of facts without being able to make sense of the apparently unrelated facts .
The process of learning will in turn become isolated parts that do not form a illstrative whole .
Thus , any student who can only master one ability among the two will find himself/herself crippled in his/her studies , and it is unlikely that he/she will do well in hes/her studies in the academic area .
In history , any great scientific and academic advancement is built upon the premises of both theoretical ideas and concepts and facts based on practical application of theories , and the successful combination of both results in so many instances of intellectual progress in history .
Without either one of these two abilities , the world we live in and our perception of the world will be very limited .

To sum up , it is equally important for students to understand ideas and concepts and to learn facts .
A mastery of both abilities will enable students to witness greater achievements in their studies .

"Nowadays , more and more students start to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .
Actually it is a very good way for they to succeed in their studying fields because of the following reasons .

First , ideas and concepts are the roots of any study .
If a student does not understand the ideas and concepts , how can he/she find relations with the real life ?
Facts are revelant to the ideas and concepts , but after ideas and concepts are discovered , then we can apply the ideas and concepts to the facts .
So ideas and concepts are more important than facts .

In addition , ideas and concepts can apply to problems while studying .
As mentioned , they are the origins of the studies .
Therefore any problems related to the study should be based on the ideas and concepts or they can be expansions of the ideas and concepts .
For instance , in geometry studies , there are a lot of theories in a circle .
The theories are the concepts and ideas .
From these theories , teachers can develop more and more problems .
If a student does well in the circle test , he/she must have mastered the ideas and concepts of the circle very well .
Or he/she would not get good mark just by learning facts .

Futhermore , while doing a lecture about some course , the students are required to expand his/her topic from the ideas and concepts .
They are not taught to give the lecture right from the facts .
Because starting from the facts will make the lecture hard to be accepted by others who are not familiar with the topic .
The ideas and concepts are always the basis of any lecture .
Afterwards , the facts can be displayed fully to the listeners .
This is what a memorable lecture requires .

In conclusion , ideas and concepts usually are the paramount factors of any study .
Therefore , it is more important for sutdents to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact .
Then they will be mastering knowledges better in the future .

"I disagree with the statement .
In my opinion , people understand ideas and concepts by learning the facts .
It seems that we are unable to get the ideas or concepts untill we really know the fatcs .

First , it is difficult for us to get the new idea or concept right away .
For instance , whenever the professors gives the new lecture , they need to organise the materials and manage to set up the lecturing in order to make students understand what they teach in class .
In fact , most professors would introduce the ideas and concepts at the beginning of the lectures , explain the details by taking some examples , and summarize the essence by the end of the lectures .
obviously , it could make students understand better , even though not all of the students stay on the same level .

Second , some ideas and concepts are really abstract , especially those mathematical issues .
we usually learn fast as long as we practise by ourselves .
for example , I still remember my mathematical teach back to primary school .
Obviously , she did great job to teach us how to undertand the classes and how to work out the questions .
One day , when we talked about the square of the objective , our teacher got a few students to stand up and measure the length and width of our classroom so that we could figure out the exact numbers of objective and caculate the square of the room immediately .
As a result , we learnt the idea and concept through the factss we did .

In conclusion , I personally believe that people hardly to understand the ideas and concepts unless they learn the facts .
Facts help us to completely understand and solve
",P7,CHI,high,0
"I agree with understanding ideas and concerpts are more important for students because the ideas and concepts help us to understand the facts .

When we learn something in our class or on textbook , the first thing comes up is the theory or concerpt .
Then professor will explain the concerpt .
Later on , he gives students some examples to help us to understand it , Why professor or textbook always gives us a theory , then provides some facts to explain the theory ?

After we learn a concept , we need to totally undersatnd it .
So we need an example , even some facts to explain the concept .
It is a easy way for students to learn .

Second , after we understand the ideas , we always can use the concepts to expalin other things .
We can use the ideas that we learn in diffrent ways .
For example , when we use a camera to take some pictures .
We understand the relationship between light and curve mirror .
We can make a simple camera base on our knowledge .

Third , the fact can not reflect everything .
Everyone gives a respones differently because people are different from their family background , education and friends .
They have vary opinions about a same fact .
On the other hand , ideas and concepts are always the same , they never chnage .

Finally , facts can tell us what have happened in the world .
But if we do n't have some ideas or concepts , what can we deal with some problems ?
If we have some acknowledge , when some facts come up , we can explain how they happen .
Likes , everydays news talks about the Federal Reserves raises the interest rate and a bloom of an expansion in US .
We know the fact but we do n't know why it happen , how it is going to be .
Concepts help us to understand more about our surrounding .

In my conclusion , I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students to learn .
They can have basic concepts , then they have abilities to explain about things .
Moreover , they can use their knowledge to becaome their skills .
Then concepts vary not depend on different people .
And ideas and concepts help to understand the facts .

"The issue at hand is that learning through understanding ideas and learning through facts , which one is more important for students ?
This issue is very important , becasue learning knowledges and studying trough different methods are very important for the students future career .
I believe learning facts is more important , for some reasons .

Learning facts is preferable because facts offer a lot of experiences that are very rare , and also easily understandable .
Those experiences are from outside of the classrooms , they come from the real world , using these experience facts , students can learn knowledge faster , they will save time to study other knowledges .
This is very important for the students ' future career , the reason is that most of the employers are glad to hire employees who can work immedietely , since this kind of employees can bring the profits to company as soon as they are hired .
For example , operating a machine should n't be very hard for the students , because they have already understood those ideas and concepts , but when these students begin to work in the real factories for the first time , they are still confused about those operations , because they do n't have the experiences of operating those machines .
Based on this reason , learning factors is superior to understanding ideas and concepts , because learning concepts can only offer students general knowledge , concepts can not give students more skills about the real work .

Additionally , I believe learning facts is a right option because facts are usually more interesting and active , so , they can be remembered easily by the students .
Trying to think about this : concepts that only presents on the papers with black characters and videos shows the real production processes in a factories , which one is more attractive ?
which one would you like to choose ?
I believe the answer is very obvious .
So , I like learning facts over just understanding ideas and concepts due to the fanny that I can find in the learning the facts .

To sum up , I believe learning facts is the correct choice , I would choose this because I believe students can remember more knowledges when they learning facts , and also , facts include a lot of real experiences which is rare and very important for the students to start the future work .

"With the current trend of stressing a person 's ability to understand and apply ideas in modern workplace , a dillema that whether understanding concepts is more important for students than learning facts arose .
I strongly disagree with the statement as learning facts is a indispensoble process of a person 's development and should be highly emphasized .

The primary reason is that the facts we learned and accumulated are the foundation to bulid up and enhance our understanding of ideas .
When we were young , we had limited ability to understand the world around us .
It was the facts we told by parents , media and society helped us to generate a preliminary understanding of functions and roles of materials surrounded us .
Our understanding gradually developed by considering the facted we learned and applied it to the situation we face .
With the more facts , we would be able to unambiguously inteprete ideas and help us to apply in real world situation .
Therefore , learning facts is conducive to consolidate the foundationa and explore our capacity of comprehending concepts we encounter in later stage .

Learning facts also helps to develop an appropriate cognition of ourselves in the whole community .
Facts of the past and present time of various subjects and aspects of human community enable us to contruct our comprehension of our roles in society and help us to determine our career and life goals .
Without sufficient information , we might narrow our scope and focus our attention on a limited facet of problems we met as well as life decisions .
Learning facts broaden our horizon and enable us to explore our lives in all sorts of directions .

As a nutshell , the ability of comprehending concepts would only be practicle and utilitarian in real life situations when a person has assimilated adequate facts for him to make corresponding decision .

As far as i am concern , it is more important for strudent to learn facts than it is for them to just understand ideas and concepts due to the interest , senses , and assistance of understanding the concept .

In the first place , learning facts of the statement is more interesting than for students to understand and then memorize the concepts accurately .
Usually , the ideas and concepts are word-for-word stated on the text book and most students do not understand it without teacher 's explaination .
This explaination is required from the teachers offering the facts , which are related tothe concepts on the text book , are easier to understand and memorize .
For example , to understand the concept of The First Law of Conservation Energy - no energy is destroyed or produced in the tranformation of energy , students would choose to understand the facts that the energy has different types of energy such as potential energy and gravitational energy .
Also , an interesting diagram which contains how eneryghg is being transfer would be helpful for students to unterstand the First Law of Conservation Energy .

Moreover , common sense of facts for understanding a complicated concept is useful for students .
Students would use what they see and think in daily life to understand everything they have difficulities with .
For instance , students would understand the water property of adhesion in the example of the water strikes walking on the surface of the water .
In biology , learning facts of all the living things are very important for the student to success since the biology is all based on the fact of lives .

On top of that , the reason why i disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them for learn facts is because learning facts are also help students easier to understand the ideas of the study .

"Nowadays , there are numorous debats on whether or not understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning the facts .
From my point of view , I agree with the statement that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The following reasons will support my opinion from three perspectives .

First of all , ideas and concepts are the foundation of the facts .
In addition , in the most textbooks , every chapter begins with the terms and definitions of the ideas and concepts .
At the begining of every chapter the professor will ask students to understand every terms and ideas which is included in this chapter .
Because every subjects have some speical terms the students did not hear before .
If they do not understand these ideas and concepts , they will have a lot of difficulties to learn the facts about these ideas .

Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts will help students to learn facts more effiectively and efficiently .
When the students understand and memorize all the ideas and concepts which they are going to learn about , they are get ready to accept the new facts related to these ideas .
Forthermore , they will familiar to these facts by the means of they understand ideas and concepts .
All of these will help students to learn the facts quickly and correctly .

Thirdly , students learning facts indicate to memorize the concepts correctly and accurately .
In the school , the first objection of students are learning the academic knowlege which refers to the ideas and concepts .
Later , they will use these knowlege in the working place and connect the ideas with the facts .
Therefore , in the school students should concentrate on the ideas and concepts , meanwhile , they can use the facts to help them memorize the ideas and concepts accurately .

Firstly , the facts is based on the ideas and concepts .
Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts is a good way for students to learn the facts .

Students are asked to understand ideas and concepts from the subjects they are learning .
They are also asked to learn facts from past experiences .
However , which one is the thing they need more , understanding ideas or learning facts ?
In my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students .

To begin with , students go to school because they need to gain knowledge that are needed for their future .
Student should be able to understand that the ideas and concepts of the subjects they are studying , so that they will understand the subjects easier .
For example , the use of a mathematical formula , the rule of a chemical equation .
Without the understanding the ideas and concept , they do not know how to use it and when should they apply it on .

As being a student , I think that when student have the ideas and concepts of something , they will eventually understand the facts of something too .
Since a fact of an event or object is actually the result of the development of a centain kind of ideas and concepts .
In the other word , ideas and concept are the basic requirement for student to learn a facts .

Moveover , some people think that learning facts is more improtant for students than understand ideas and concepts .
It is because they believe that facts is more easier for students to understand something nesscessary for thier life .
But their never understand that facts can only tell use the surface of somethings , not the meaning that are behind them .

Some think that learning fact is the most essential thing ; others argue that understanding ideas is more important in learning .
There have been an agruement for a long time .
In my opinion , I agree that to understand idea and concept is more important .

My first reason is that understanding concept is the basis when we study , but memorizing facts will limit students ' thinking .
Once we understand the concept of the question , it will be mush easier to solve the problem by using the concept and idea .
On the other hand , if students only focus on the text and memorize the fact which is found by others , they lose the chance to think about the question on their own .

Another reason is that understanding concept and idea will help students to extend their own ideas .
Knowing the concept is the basis for innovation .
For example , although many inventors do not accept regular education , they practise and extend their own idea and imagination just based on the concept .
Most of the inventions are from the concept of materials and the inventor 's creativity .
In other words , without just learning the fact from books , understanding concept give students more space to imaginate and try .

"The issue of whether understanding ideas and concepts is more important to students than learning facts .
Some people assert that understanding concepts is more important , while others believe that learning facts is more important .
Different people have different views due to their distinct backgrounds .
As a matter of fact , this issue is complex and controversal one and whether one choice takes precendence ovr the other may quite depend one the specific situation .
As far as I am concerned , I disagree with this statement and my view can be substantiated by the following discussion .

The first argument can be presented is ideas and concepts are usually unrealistic and un-practical .
A good example is about my major - physical therapiest .
Many of classmates could get good scores in the lecture , but they could not get good scores in the lab or being interns in the hospital because they could make a good connection between what they had learned and the clinic situation .

Under this circumstance , I really think learning facts is very important .

In addtion , there is another reasons to support my standpoint and a good example is not far to seek .
Before going abroad , people buy the travelling guide book and understand the environment and culture of the country to which they are going .
But sometimes , people feel what the book mentions is too abstract to understand and therefore , the best way is going that country and have the real experience .

Admittedly , it may be true understanding ideas and concepts is very basic and important for students in some specific situation .
However , this alone does n't constituate a sufficienct support to claim above statement .
Actually , these cases are rare and thus are too specific and too weak to strenthen this standpoint .
When the advantages and disadvantages of understanding concepts and learing facts are carefully examined , the most striking conclsuion is abvious that learing facts is much more important .

To sum up , although the statement still arouses diagreement among different people , the issue is quite difficut to resolve .

Firstly , facts change all the time .
For example , in the incient times , people thought that when the poplulation is higher , the food production will be higher ; and the growth of food is slower than the growth of population , that leads them to control birth .
However , they had not predicted the development of technology .
Consequently , facts are changing .
Therefore , we could not learn all of the facts .
The important thing is we should understand the ideas and the concepts , then we could apply in different matters .

Besides , as I mentioned , we should apply pur knowledge rather than memorize the facts .
For instance , we memorize the GDP of every countries , but we have no idea about the GDP ; what affect the GDP and what does it show us .
As a result , we cannot learn facts that we do n't understand and we can n't apply .
If we cannot understand the ideas of the facts , the facts would be useless .
Therfore , we have to be able to understand the ideas and concepts than learn the facts .

Finally , since we learn how to apply our knowledge from understaning ideas and concepts .
We can have abilities to solve problems because we have difficulties all the time .
For example , we can understand the concepts of developing films and printing pictures , so that we can adjust the colour , light , or the size we want .
By showing this example , it can help us to understand that it is important for us to understand and apply through different circumstances .

In conclusion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the changes of facts , application of knowledge and the advantages of understanding ideas .

"Learning concepts and facts are two common elements in the process of learning .
However , which one is important than the other one ?
I disagree with the statement that `` It is more important for students to understands ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
In my point of view , learning facts is much more important than learning concepts and ideas .

It is important to learn facts in the begining of a learning process .
Before learning a new thing , we have no ideas about it .
Therefore it is important to us know about the facts which are most outter side of a thing .
For example , when a baby is learning what an apple is , they only recognize that an apple is a round red thing .
He does not need to know that apple is a fruit which is an living thing and how it grows .

Another example is that when we study history , we always have know about the facts first .
We have to know what , where , when and how first .
After we knowing the facts , we starts learning the concepts and ideas which are hidden in the facts .
Therefore , learning the facts is important because it is the first step of a learning prcess .

Moreover , learning facts is important because it is a easy and direct way to learn something .
Understanding ideas and concepts play a supporting role in the process of learning .
It is because understanding ideas and concepts allows us to know more about how the facts work in their ways .
If we only understand ideas and concepts but not focus on the facts , we do not even know what we are learning and absorbing .
In other words , it is useless to only know the ideas but ignore the facts .
Facts are concrete and solidary things that we have to know about in learing .

In conclusion , it is imprtant for students to learn facts that it is for them to understand ideas and conc
",P7,CHI,high,0
"I think understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than simply learning so-called `` facts '' .

History has repeatedly proved that past `` facts '' turn out to be false .
For example , people used to think that all species on earth were created by God and they remain the same all the time .
Today , almost all biologists believe that evolution is the driving force behind all species , past and present .
As environment change , old species extinct and new species emerge .
God has no role in evolution .
Consequently , learning the facts may leave you with wrong information .

If remembering facts is not good , will understanding ideas and concepts help ?
Definitely .
If we think about the above example , people believe God as the only creator of species because they do n't question the claim and never ask for valid evidence to support it .
The idea behind such claim should then be `` How do we know ? ''
Well , in 1859 Charles Dalwin gave many evidence in his historical `` On the Origin of Species : The Theory of Evolution '' .
As time goes by , many scientists found more and more evidence to support the theory .
Such evidence lies in fossils , similarities between living plants and animals and their ancient ancestors and even DNA of all organisms .
We now know all living things share the same universal hereditary code , i.e. , DNA .

Some people may argue that learning facts help a lot when you do n't have access to information you need .
Like when a nurse wants to know how many grams equal to an ounce .
However , in the modern `` Information Time '' when internet is universally accessible and most facts are available on you fingertips .
Most hospital units in the U.S.A. are equipped with computers connected to the internet .
A nurse can simply `` google '' `` gram to ounce '' and get the conversion rate right away .
We no longer need to remember all the `` facts '' .

Ideas are more important than facts .
",P7,CHI,high,0
"Recently , many students try to find an effective and efficient way to study , but they are always confused by the dilema : Understanding ideas is the first priority or learning facts is more important ?
From my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts other than learning facts .
And this can be fully explained from three aspects : First , nowdays people have more access to those facts so they do n't have to memorize them ; Second , Understanding is more essential to help student to be more adaptable ; Third , understanding helps students to develop creativity , which is the key force in this technology world .

First of all , facts are easy to be found .
Nowadays people have a variety of ways to acquire data and information .
Books , magazines , Internet , video tapes are all the powerful resources which help students to learn facts .
For example , a student can easily get what happened in Canada in 1870 from the internet , He or she just simply type : `` What happened in Canada in 1870 '' , he or she can get thousands of ariticles and tests which are related to the topic .
Moveover , the informaiton is saftely saved and preserved from all those medias mentioned before , so what is the point to try to memorize all the terms and fact ?
It is a waste of time obviously .

Second , Understanding is more important to get ideas .
It is better to teach a man fishing skills other than just give him fishes everyday .
For example , if you just memorize `` 1 + 1 = 2 , 1 + 2 = 3 , 1 + 3 = 4 ... `` but do n't know really understand the concept of the rule of addition , next time I give you a question `` 1 + 100 = ? '' , you still do n't know how to do it .
On the other hand , if you know the rule of addition , that 's much enough .
You do n't have to memorize any facts such as `` 1 + 56 = 57 '' , you can do any addition questions .
That simple .

Last but not least , understanding helps students to be more creative .
As we know , this is a technology era , creativity seems more important than just accepting .
In order to understand , a student has to push himself thinking in a deep level , which helps to develop logical thinking and critical thinking skills .
The more a person thinks , the more knowledgable he or she tend to be .
Hence , he or she will understand more and be more creative .
This is simply because they can apply what they have learned and understanded into different situation .

In conclusion , learning facts is simple and brutal while understanding is deep and essential .
Understanding ideas can let students be more knowlegable and creative while passively accepting and memorizing facts is just a waste of time .
So it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

"When people think of successful people , they think of a person who is willing to try new things and taking risks in life , a person who always jumps out of the comfort zone where he or she is so used to .
I completely agree with this statement .

In the business realm , new oppotunies are always there but lie in the hidden , unknown and risky areas .
Many people may see the oppotunity , but only successful ones are willing to take the risk to explore it .
Nowadays everyone is talking about the double-digit ecnomic growth of China and I believe no one on earth can not see the oppotunities there .
However , only a small handful of them could actually take the action to jump into this unkown territory and strike great success .

When students graduate from college , they usually think of finding a job related to their major .
Rarely do we see students are willing to explore new domains or unknown areas for more oppotunities .
However , it is usually from these small group of students who are willing to experiment new things where successful people emerge .
Take my personal experience as an example .
When I graduated with a computer engineering degree , I did not go routinely to search for an IT or engineering job , but instead , I jumped into a very new field called `` Bioinformatics '' by spending another two years in graduate schools for a master degree .
It was a daring move at that time because there was virtually zero `` Bioinformatics '' industry in the country I live in .
However , two years later , I embraced the prosperous of the field .

Our society needs all kinds of people .
Sometimes we can not judge a person 's success by measuring how much money he or she earns .
There are many great successful people out there doing notable work to our society , the poor people and the environment .
Many of them had their careers , and had lived their life comfortably .
But they did not choose to live on that way , but jumped out of the comfortable zone and did something more marvelous .

To begin with , trying news things and taking risks make it posssible for people to boost their own business .
There is no doubt that the world is changing all the time .
If people still stick to so what they already know , it is almost impossible to make a living in the competition of the market today .

Invention needs creative mind while crestive mind needs trying of new things .
Many famous scientists eventually become successful only because they are willing to try many different kinds of things .

For example , if a man is doing his new experiment , he has tried more than five hundreds time to test the experiment , he may eventually gain priceless conifidence once he accomplishes the experiment successfully .
Successful business esalways have some risks .
Thus , in order to become successul in business world , people have to take some risks .
As long as they get through the risks , then they would taste the fruit of success .

First idea comes in to my mind is the definition of successful , that is outstanding which has the same meaning of standing out .
It is to say those successful people should be different from ordinary people .
How to be different ?
The answer definitly not only doing what others already know how to do well .
It is reasonable that the awards usually go to those who try new thinks and take risks because they are outstanding .

Second try new things and take risks can make people more open minded and gain more knowledge and finally make them successful .
When try new things you can get another point of view of the problem .
I can remember that my senior design project was to design a control system for hot blast stoves .
Pervious people solve this kind of problem by classical control methods , however my teammember and I decided to try intellengence method although our advisor warned us that we might fail .
Guess the result , we not only acheived our project successfully , but also got undergraduate research prize .

Reading the history books you may find that each huge development of the world has some relationship with the new inventions .
And more and more schools teach students the invent ability is the most important quality to become successful nowadays .

Look at another side of the statement and suppose that if people only repeated doing what they already know how to do well .

First , if someone wants to be succeed , he or she must try to do something new , something others never did before , it is just like invention , new things are always the things people focus on , that is why people are interest on new cell phones and computers but not regular phones and calculators , the future successful people has to find something that can interest people , but as an addition , there are always risks while introducing a new product or working in a new field , but if people want to recieve , they have to give , people who want to be succeed must give up doing the thing they already know how to do well , but learn to do a new thing , for most times , there are n't even books to introduce how to do the new thing , but once one people finds out how to do and does it well , he or she may be secceed throughtout one night .
Many people surround me are worrying about their jobs , some because they ca n't find a job , some worries about how far they can go in their career , for those who want to be more excellent than others , who are looking forward to be successful people , wo n't only try to do better than others in the same thing , because as people always say ` what you can do , others can do ' , take Bill Gates for example , when he was determind to found a software company he was only an college student , bravely , he did n't scared by the risk but went out from the college to the true world to discover new things , to chase new goals , at the time he had a friend who ahd the same major as Bill did , rejected the invetion of Bill Gates to found a new company together , may be he thought it is more unrisky to continue his study , or maybe he still thinks so now , but after years , Bill Gates becomes , we can say a legent of success , every body admire him , and seeking for ways to be as successful as him , and his classmate at college I 've mentioned before , is now a college proffessor , I 'm not saying that being a proffesor is not successful , it is also a marvolous job , but in most people 's opinion , being best one in the world , is cooler , and a people like Bill Gates , is the most successful one .

It may depends on that kind of life people want , but if people want to bu really successful , I think the best way is to face the risks and do new things others never did before , there sure will be failures , but if he or she succeed , it will be a huge pride .

"I definitely agree that successful people are more willing to try new things and take more risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Because they are not affraid of changing , they have more chances , and they know that you need to take risks to find new ways , they can become successful people .

First of all , successful people are not affraid of changing what they already had .
They do n't stay still and they always want something new .
Success often comes with something different from the established ones .
For example , the success of the website of youtube '' is because it 's new and unique .
Therefore , it grabs everyone 's attention .
If people always do things that they knew very well , their lives will be all the same .
Successful people are willing to try anything new and find new things that help them succeed .

Furthermore , because successful people are willing to try new things and take risks , they have more chances to succeed .
They do n't have limitations .
Therefore , they have more opportunities than those who always do the same routine things .

In addition , successful people know that every investment has its own risk and life is full of risks .
In fact , they love to roll the dice , and to see what will happen next .
That 's why life is so special .
You never know what will happen next .
It may take you to the successful life , and it may take you to the totally failure as well .
During the process of trying new things , successful people always gain some valuable experiences which help them become more successful .

To sum up , successful people are not affraid of changing their lives and are willing to try new things .
They take risks and they do n't worried about losing what they 've owned .
During these trials and errors , they always gain some experiences which make them successful in the future .

"Poeple strive for success in many ways .
Some people specialize in what they already know how to do well .
Others , however , are brave enough to try new things and take risks .
Given the fact that we are living in a rapidly changing society , I agree that successful people are the latter ones who continuoulsy change their paths of life .

Firstly , trying new things and taking risks often leads people to see new opportunities .
The technology and business are changing fast .
If people stick to the old ways of thinking , they may be left behind by the society .
So we should be open-minded to the new environment .
For example , Bill Gates , the founder of Microsoft , took great risks when he decided to quit from university and start his own business .
That was indeed a very brave and insightful choice for an undergraduate student to make .
Because Bill Gates seized the new opportunity without hesitation , he gained great success .

Noy only can we have new opportunities by taking risks , there is also higher rate of return .
When people only do what they already know how to do well , they have little room for improvement .
Thus they cannot gain more for themselevs nor contribute more to the society .
In contrary , high risks often implys high rate of return .
Those who try new things often get more because of the risks undertaken .
My Marketing professor , for example , changed his career several times from amanager to aconsultant to a professor .
He really gains much life experience and at the same time makes good fortune .

As stated above , trying new things and taking risks would bring people valuable opportunities and good return .
We all live in a increasingly competitive society .
That is why we should adapt to the changing world by changing ourselves .
is exactly the way that leads to success .

"I agree that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they are already know how to do well '' .
As we are in the 21 century , the world is fast changing , so we need to keep learning new things so that we can keep up with the world 's step .
If someone wants to be susseccful , only follow the others is definitly not enough .
A successful man , a talent , must know have to lead behind the people , he must always be one step faster than the ordinary people , thus taking risks is quite necessary .
Only follow the traditions and rules and do the things `` what they already how to do well '' will never make people successful and even may destroy them , makes them the ones how can not follow the changing world .
People should not hesitate to take risks .
Talents take risks , they never afriad of losing because it will only make them stronger .
No one can deny that Thomas Edison is a successful man .
He is probably the most famous inventor of the world ; he is the father of modern light .
What does a inventor do everyday ?
He takes risk .
If Thomas Edison has not invented modern light , the world will be complete different today .
Another example of successful people try new things and take risk is founder of Microsoft Corporation , Bill Gates .
He has studied in a famous university but he has stopped doing `` what he already know how to do well '' .
He has quited from the university and has started his own business .
Now , he is the richest man is the world .
He owns billions of dollars and everyone who has a personal computer use his `` Windows '' software program .
He is successful and he takes risks .
`` Only doing what they already know how to do well '' only makes people nobodies .
Every year , millions of skilled and experienced old worker in developing countries like China , retire from factories .
They have kept doing their works , `` what they already know how to do well '' every workday .
When they finally retired , they have found that they are nobodies and are not successful at all .
It is their fault that they have not taken risks .
If they have started business or got other creative ideas , they may have much better lives now .
In conclusion , successful people are more likely to take risks .

"One thing I have learned from both experience in reality and in academic training is that truth should be stated with qualifications , So I would say that this statement is not a hundred percent true .
Successful people in my definition , at least do one thing better than others .
And as the limitation of human life and energy in contrast with the immense diverse activities that might be of interest to you , I feel that successful people are more specialists than generalists .

I would appreciate people with the courage and enthusiaism to try new things and take risks as this would probably lead to discovery of new knowledge of world and of oneself .
The first kind of fruits is most evident with various kinds of inventions and innovations .
Edison is an old but always appopriate example .
The man is full of creativity and spent his life exploiting this talent , leaving us hundreds of inventions and shine up our lives literally .

The second part of the meaning of trying new things is more subtle .
This is actually in accordance with the Delphic words : `` Know thyself '' .
I personally believe not many of us know what materials we are at an early stage of life .
Much of our time and energy is spent in a trial and error pprocess which may last to different stages of our life depending on the difference of perseverance and energy and luck .
We try new things to see a new us and the experience is our treasure that we carry on .
Some people are quite lucky to know what they want at a relatively early age but this does not mean they are unsuccessful , on contrast , their chance of success may be higher as they have more time to develop that aspect as we agree that it is not easy to really do something better than others .
Mozart and Bethoven who I bet did not do major things outside music and they do it from childhood .
They demonstrate their expertise from very young and this is the only passion of their life .
This is quite the same situation with other genius .
They know how to write well , paint well or compose well and they do it all the time .
They may try other things as a diversion , but I guess what we label them successful rests on this main talent .

So different people can succeed in different ways .
I would not think it very wise to identify characteristics and qualities that a successful person must possess .
A spirit of discovery and exploration would be helpful .
As we generally do not know what we will do well , it is natrual that we have higher chances to discover it by trying new things and taking risks .
A higher probablity is stated on this assumption .

Undoubtedly , a successful businessman always tries to make his business different from others ' .
The area that has never been explored by other people is always attractive to him , because he is so smart that he understands that an unexplored field always has a large potential .
Even though new things can hardly be accepted by customers initially , a farsighted businessman would rather to take this risk , becasue he understands that once he succeed in his first step , a huge profit will follow with it .

My father is also a businessman .
However , he is not one of the successful ones , since he is always afraid of challenge new things .
My uncle has a big resteraunt which is very successful .
Seeing the large profit my uncle has gained , my father decides to set up a small one as same as my uncel 's .
Even though my father is told that doing business relevent to food is not suitable for him , he insists in his decision .
However , quickly , my father finds that he has made a wrong decision as he keeps losing profit in his resteraunt .
The reason why he does not succeed is that he is not brave enough to challenge new things .
Moreover , he thinks that if he set up a resteraunt , he will be as successful as my uncle .
Consequently , without taking a risk , he fails .

In conclusion , once the mind of a bussinessman is limited , he can hardly be successful .
Sometimes , courage of taking a risk is the most pivotal factor of being successful .

"Generally speaking , there are various types of people in this diverse society .
Some people tend to risk in order to become a successful man in the world , while others are afraid of risking and trying new things because they worried about losing their money and possesions .
But personally , I agree people should try and risk new things in order to be a successful and well-know person for the following reasons .

Most importantly , people who like to try new things tend to have more possibilies to success .
In other words , they might find out something that they are very good at and start to do other things they are talented .
To give a personal example , two years ago , when I was in Saint Andrew-Sewanee School , a very small private school in Tennessee .
I took calculus course , which was extremly hard and I thought I would do terrible on that semester , as oppsed to get an A on it .
However , after I tried to study several times , I found out it was not as difficult as I imagined .
I studied hard and got an A on every quizes and tests .
Needless to say , my semester grade was an A. Consequently , I started to have interests examing the math world beyond calculus .
Now , I successfully become an expert of math due to the fact that I took risks to take calculus two years ago .

In addition , people would more likely to learn the old experience and invent something great by trying the new things .
If you keep trying new things , you would learn the experience why the old methods is not working and would find out the new method that would make it work by continuing to try .
For instance , Edison , a great inventor in the United States , invented a substance called `` light , '' which is one of the useful and neccessary items in the world nowadays .
During his experiment , he had failed to find the correct metals that would make a substance lighten .
However , he did not just five up .
Instead , he kept trying new trails and new metals thousands of times .
And eventually , he invented light .
This is a good example that people would likely to be successful by trying new things .

Ultimately , some people prefer doing what they already know how to do well , whereas others would rather try new things and take risks .
Of course , I sometimes would review what I already know .
But most of the time , I always like to try something that are unfamiliar to me .
",P8,CHI,high,0
"The quality of successful people is usually discussed .
Some say that they are more prone to be adventurers , trying new things and taking risks , rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
From my view , I totally agree with this for the following reasons .

Without trying new things , nothing can be created .
When we look back what the great people in the past like Albert Einstein does , they made a lot of imaginative assumptions , and finally he revealed the famous physics equation and the great theory of relativity .
All these discoveries have brought about many benefits to us since their establishments .

Beside theories and discoveries , all inventions we usually every day would not exist should the great scientists did not try new things and take risks .
Think about the richest person in the world , Bill Gate .
he designed a software that our lives greatly rely upon it - Windows .
Without the ventures and new ideas , our world is just the same compared to our ancestors ' .

Not only scientists but many successful political leaders have this quality .
For instance , the first American president , George Washington , taking the risk to be arrested or even killed , led people to overthrow the colonial rule .
Others include the drafters of new ideologies like democracy and fair world trade .
They dared to introduce and more importantly , to implement them .
All these bring about significant impacts today , even they might live thousand years ago .

Another reason supporting the statement is their faith to success .
Their desire to find new things is a strong motivation for their work .
If people do not try new things , they recognize all what he can do .
There will not be new impacts on their lives .
Consequently , they have less motivation to strive for success and are easily conceited with their past achievements .

On the other hand , imagine a very diligent but conservative person who does merely whatever he knows .
Eventually , he is just a master of the present knowledge .
He cannot move further and stays at whatever he is .
Without new things and ideas , it would turn out to a very boring world .
Every thing repeats as it used to be and there is no surprise at all .

Considering the above , we see that trying new things and taking risks are important attributes to successful people .

"It has been rightly said ,
`` Little knowledge is a dangerous thing ,
Drink deep or taste not the Pierian Spring ,
There small draughts intoxicate the brain ,
While drinking largely sobers us again ! ''
Indeed , I believe that instead of limiting kowledge to small draughts of one subject , it is much more beneficial to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects just like drinking largely from the Pierian Spring .

If we specialize in one subject , our knowledge is contained only within the narrow boundaries of that subject while the vast ocean of truth lies undiscovered before us .
We become ignorant about other impotant things that we need to know in order to attain a high level of intelligence and understanding .
By specializing in one subject , we tend to forget that there are millions of other possibilities in store for us , that there is so much knowlege to gain in this world and so little time .

With a broad knowledge or several things , we widen our vision and expand our horizons .
We realize that we have miles to go before we sleep .
Broad knowlege enlightens us about the vastness of this universe and makes us aware that even if we spend out entire lifetime gaining knowledge , there will still be thousands of things that we are ignorant about .

Another important fact is that various aspects of knowledge are related to one another .
Without being aware of other subjects , knowledge of our own subject becomes constricted and we tend to have a narrow minded approach towards things .
Moreover , if facts are bricks , accumulation of facts is as much knowledge as a pile of bricks is a house .
We need to know what is going on around us to put our knowledge to good use .

Also , practically speaking , what use is speacialization in one subject in our daily lives ?
Is a Ph .
D in microbiology going to help us cope with the obstacles of everyday life ?
Only awareness of every branch of academics can enable us to practically gain benefits .

So , it is my firm opinion that one should try to learn as much as possible in this short life given to us .
I , personally , would prefer to be a jack of all trades rather than a master of just one .

"There is an old saying which states -

`` Jack of all trades and master of none ''

I personally believe that being jack of all trades and master of none would never do any good to anyone .

This leads to my disagreement with the given statement which states it is better to have broad knowledge of many fields than to specialize in one specific subject .

I do not deny the fact that it is important for one to have a broad knowledge of various academic subjects , but in no way is it better than to specialize in one specific subject .

Academics is all about gaining knowledge .
Ever since our childhood , we are taught various subjects .
Initially a child is taught the basics and then gradually the intricacies of the subject would be taught .
On one hand , where it is good to know the basics of a subject , on the other hand it also becomes very important to attain specialization in one particular area of one 's interest .

It is said ` Half knowldege is a dangerous thing ' .

When you know something of every thing and nothing of one particular thing , it might result in serious disaster .

For example , if a medical student who has not pursued his masters in nuerology is made to give a treatment to a patient with nervous breakdown , then , with his limited knowledge of whatever nuerology was taught to the him in his initial years of pursuing medicine , the student might end up in taking the patient 's life altogether .

What patient needs is not a person with varied knowledge in different streams , but a nuero surgeon who is a specialist .

Another reason why it becomes important to attain specialization is the fact that every body is blessed with one or the other skill .
And so , a complete justice must be made to whatever skill one is blessed with .
Now this can only be achieved if the person shows perseverance and dedication towards his potential in the skill and attains expertise in it .

For instance , a work which is done by a carpentar could never be done with the same finnese by a plumber , how ever talented the plumber might be .

Each one of us have our own talents and skills and so we must pursue them further till the skills reach pinnacle of finnese and perfection .

Primarily , if only a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is given to a student and the students decides not to go for perfection , he would not only end up messing his own life , but also of many others surrounding him .

The whole world would then be filled up with many people who know many things , tits and bits of every thing but the indepth knowledge would be misisng .

This would mean , there would be no doctors , no lawers , no engineers and no researches .

Where as , the specialization would enhance one 's capability , one talent and potential and make this whole world a lot better place to live in .

Conclusion :
It is important for a students or an individiual to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects but what is more important is to gain specialization in one of the fields which interests or appeals the most to the student .
This would not only place the entire education system in an order but would also result in a highly talented pool of individuals who would be of some worth to the society and inturn would become its priced assets .

An indepth knoweldge is always better than having half acquired knowledge .
Where on one hand the latter could destoy the civilization , the former would develop the whole civilzation and would make this whole world a much better place to live in .

So knowledge in depth about the particular topic or a subject can result in many interesting conclusions and its amazing results can benefit people later on .
Though it requires a lot of hardwork to have knowledge in depth but on the other hand it can help the world with new discoveries and inventions .

But along with the specialization one needs to take care regarding the fattigue which results to an individual practising the same instrument for many years .
As a result along with specialization person should involve in various other activities too so that his interest in a particular application is maintained .
Since its the world of specialization so we need to be specialized in a particular task and help this world with its demanding needs .
And along with it we need to take care of our interests , refresh ourselves well within time and work more enthusiastically in future .

"Though I agrees with the notion that specializing on a specific subject have more potential for contribution to knowledge as a whole , but I also thinks that confining to a specific line of discipline may leads to missing of understanding of how everything fits together .
There are other points which leads to my standpoint .

We live in an information age in which we have access to a sea of data .
Furthermore , each subject area in itself has lots of academic literature about the knowlege accumulated throughout the ages in it .
Only ff a person confine to a specialzed field and narrow down the point of focus , innovative research is possible .
It may appear that in an attempt to gain wider knowledge , the student can just study what is available without getting any chance to contribute to it .
Though this is true , we should not miss the point that by understanding the context and knowing how things work together can only takes one to a position that can lead him to actually contribute to the field .
Historically , many of our researcher have contributed to a large variety of scientific discipline and proving the fact that knowing all peices together gives a unique perspective and hence innovation .
Like thomas edison , leonardo da Vinci , Nicholas Tesla are all prolific researcher contributing to all scientific discipline .

I also believe that some scientific discipline like Medicine , only being specialist can provide proper skill to perform well .
We trust only specialist when it comes to medical treatment .
Why we go to eye specialist when we have an eye problem rather than a general physician .
The reason being that our body part are so complex that it requires a focussed pursuit of specialized knowledge to understand it .
But this does not strongly supports specialist because it is the general physician who also hold vital position in giving initial treatment and direct or recommend physician only in case it crosses it 's limit .
Here we see again that general physician 's varied knowledge allow him to better understand and diagonise the problem initially .

So in the society we live in today both speacialist ; who pusue specialisation in subject , and Generalist ; who have broader knowledge of subject , are important .
Giving importance to any one will be unjustified ; if not problematic .

"Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects without a specific specialization would give one information that is excessive , irrelevant , desultory in nature if it has to be applied to one 's vocation , service , a profession .
So I would disagree with the pursuit of many fields of study without any subject to specialize in .

For example , if a student of engineering pursues courses in performing arts , like dance , it might enhance the talent and social value of the person but it would not contribute to his performance in his role as an academician or a professional as an engineer .

Each subject has many specializations within its field .
Education in itself is expensive .
Compared to the working population , for various reasons , a relatively smaller percentage of people pursue education after high school , earn a baccalaureate degree and then begin , complete Graduate School also .
For example , Psychology has other sub-fields of Clinical , Counseling , Education which serve different purposes in helping the recipients of its services .
Or let 's take the example of a doctor who has taken courses in various subjects rather than emphasizing his learning in surgery , or medicine , or cancer .
How can he/she help patients to get well with a broad knowledge that covers subjects of political science , medicine , english etc . ?

If the schools of higher learning do not build their departments around a particular subject , for example , social work or social policy ; the administration , teaching , evaluation the courses being taught would suffer seriously .
Till secondary school level , many academic subjects can be learnt and it is good for our general knowledge .
But as the focus of education shifts to colleges and universities , it makes sense intellectually , practically , knowledge-wise to specialize in one specific subject .
This would help people to fulfil various roles , perform the services required to have a functional society .
The society , its educational , social and health systems would be in chaos in the event of a scenario where education would lack focus , training , depth in every particular field of study .

"` Do good and do it well ' .
I firmly believe in this adage .
I believe that an accomplishment in one academic subject can win laurels to an individual rather than basking in the false'glory ' of being the ` jack of all trades ' .

According to me even if a person has has a broad knowledge rof many academic subjects , it is of no good .
Scientifically , the human mind can register information only to a certain extent .
When the information is of diverse nature and quantity , the brain tends to faulter , hence creating chaos in the mind of the individual .
This has an obvious impact-inadequate , misleading and incomplete information .
Besides the personal loss , it has a profound impact on the people around the individual .
The people grasp the so - called ` information ' , which is of no good to them , ultimately leading to incoherence in their minds too .
This leads to a cumulative multiplication of misleading facts .
It is analogous to an attempt to sail on two boats simultaneously .
Hence broad knowledge is not concise , not informative and at times misleading .
It neither educates nor enlightens , infact it causes destruction in the long run .

On the other hand , having specific , detailed knowledge regarding a subject not only satiates the individual , it is advantageous in the long run too .
Detailed knowledge regarding one subject leads to enhancement of personal skills .
It fosters the individual with self confidence .
Specialisation enables a person to put his knowledge to practical use .
For instance , a scientist can carry out research on an issue only when he is well informed regarding the issue .
At that instant it his detailed knowledge regarding that subject which counts .
If people did not have specific knowledge , innumerous mysteries would have remained unfolded .
As a famous adage says , ` too many cooks , spoil the broth ' according to me , too many thoughts in the mind can also produce disastrous effects .
We cannot expect an individual to be painter , historian and a scientist at the same time ; rather we better not .
Specialisation takes into account , scope for further improvement as well as further strenghtening of skills .

So ultimately , its better to stick to one subject rather than misguiding yourself and the others by unneccesarily trying to gain knowledge

"the current era is the era of developing and ever growing information .
the amount of knowledge available in almost every field is increasing .
i think it is important that a person is specialized and has all the required skills and knowledge of one particular discipline .

as the old saying goes , `` jack of all trades and master of none '' somebody who knows too many subjects may not be able to master any particular subject this is the age of specialization .
specialization requires constant efforts in one direction .
so if a person wants to specialize in a particular subject , they will be required to regard that particular subject as priority and other subjects as subsidiary

also to be able to contribute in a particular fireld , one needs to put in more efforts and time in knowing that particualr field , leaving less or little time to gain knowledge about other subjects .

specializing in particular subject would help in complete knowledge of that paricular matter .
there would be less of confusion and more scope for exprimenting with the details and existing knowledge .
this is extremely imporatnt for scientists or other professionals involved in the field of advancment of knowldge

in the current time of cut throat knowledge , complete information of particular subject is required to gain an edge over others in the same field

i dont intend to say that having information about other fierlds would do any harm .
on the other hand , the information from other subjects but related subjects might prove useful .
for instance a politician would benefit greatly from knowing the history of the region or teh technological aspects of a particular powerplant in his region is working .
however he does not need detailed and technical knowledge .
he needs to know enough that would help him with his role as a politician .

"I disagree with the issue that a person should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject because of many reasons .
First of all , like it is said that little knowldge is dangerous and harmful .
When u know about a lot of subjects but a very little of each , you may probably mislead others because you are not aware of small n accurate information which can lead to a lot of problems .

Secondly , when you know about the subject in and out , you can always deal with any problem that come across that issue .
for example , if you have done a major in accounts in your college , then you can probably teach in the college or atleast help someone who is in need , because that person can trust you with the information because you are a testimony in that case .

But if you have little knowledge of many subjects , then you cant be a testimony and people will not trust you for any information becuse you do not specialise in any subjects and moreover when you are a testimony because you have specialised in one subject , you get a broader aspect of getting a good job .
but if you have a little knowledge of many subjects , you end up nowhere .

for instance , a professor who is specialised in accounting can influence others with his achievements in his field .
and can encourage others to follow one specific target in life because it leads to a brighter horizon .
But when you are not sure abt your strengths , it leads you very doubtful becuse you are not sure of your capabilities .

Atlast i would say that specializing in one subjects makes you a testimony in public for the same and it leads to a secure future becuse you are sure of what you want to do and you dont mislead others with wrong or inaccurate information .

"The statement states that broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better then in depth knowledge in one specific subject .
On the one hand the broad knowledge gives a large picture on the issue , on the other hand specilization in one subject gives an edge in the area specific to it .
However broad knowledge is better but being a specialist does n't lessen its importance .

Firstly , having knowledge about more then one academic subject or in fact many academic subjects helps a student or teacher to get a more larger view and the ability to see the things from more broader perspective .
For ex. a person knowing chemistry and biology can definitely tell better about the details of chemical reactions taking place inside the body and its effect on it as well .

Secondly , having broad knowledge helps in correlating the information from various subjects and thus enables onself to give a more holistic view of different subjects related to each other .
For instance , Physics and Mathematics are subjects which are related with each other .
Instead of merely stating the laws , if it can be proved mathematically also then it will help the audience to have better understanding of the law and thus can be easily grasped .

Finally , having broad knowledge gives an edge in making things interesting instead of just plain load of information from a specific subject .
For ex a lecturer knowing science , maths and history can definitely deliver a better and interesting lecture then a specialist of one field .

Having said about broad knowledge , it should not be overlooked the importance of specialist knowledge which is necessary when it requires to have indepth knowledge rather than just a good knowledge about many subjects .
For ex. a zeology professor explaining intricasies about the nervous system of an animal will be expected to deliver in depth knowledge about the minutiae details which obviously requires specific knowledge and not broad knowledge .

In the conclusion it can be said that it is true that broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better but that doesnt lessen the importance of specialize knowledge in one specific subject by any factor .

"Ours is a fast developing society and and we have varied branches of study in which we can gain specialization .
The question whether it is better to have a knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one subject is a very debatable one and the responses may vary from individual to individual .
here , let us anlyze the situation ..

Universities to day offer many subjects in which students can choose to major such as the sciences , math , literature and arts ...
each of these subjects also have many applied branches .
Take for instance science which comprises of medical sciences , physical sciences , astronomy and so on ...
the scope of learning today is so vast that one cannot hope to master completely even one subject , so the view of learning may subjects seems to be completely out of question ...
Therefore , I strongly support the view that students should specialize in one specific subject rather that learning a lot of subjects .
My arguments for the same go as following .

As it is said that `` THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION SHOULD HAVE A DIRECT BEARING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE '' , true as it is .
If a student focuses his energy and time on learning one subject he she can gain better expertise and thus he will be more proficient in that subject .
A proficiency in any field in turn bring with it better work opportunities and a better quality of life .
on the other hand if a student has sveral subjects to study and he cannot devite his time to one , he will probably end up being aimless and jobless too .

Here some people might counter my view by saying that .
if a person has knowledge about varied subjects he will be in a better situation to face the challenges of life .
yes , that is one fact that is undeniable but as far as professional educatipn is concerned i strongy support the idea of majoring in one subject only .

We all have plans for the future and we know what we want to be in the future , We are aware of our abilities and interests so after calculating on all these factors one should choose a field that he wants to specialize in instead of trying to learn all subjects because it is virtually impossible for mortals to retain all that they learn in school or university .
So if i want to be a computer engineer why should i be bothered about learning about the various forms of music .
The answer is obvious - it will be of no practical use to me .

In view of the facts that i mentioned above we can safely reachthe conclusion that one should focus on specializing in one field only rather than creating an anarchic situation in your mind by trying to gain expertise in various subjects .

"`` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
Or is it ?

To answer this question , first and foremost , one needs to consider the purpose of the academic pursuit that an individual is following .
Whether or not that individual should specialize in his/her line of academics , remains dependent on what the individual plans to do beyond the academics and is not limited to the course of studies only .
Considering the cut-throat competition we face in our everyday lives and in one of its subsets , our careers , `` horses for courses '' is the solution here .

To have a better understanding on the issue , lets take the case of a woman , who is studying Medicinal Chemistry and plans to be a researcher .
In her line of work , to have any kind of success , she 'd need to specialize .
For example , it would do her career a lot of good if she were to focus her research on development of Oncology drugs / anti-retroviral drugs , than merely synthesizing molecules for generic use .
In terms of position , respect , money and career growth , she 'd be better placed when specialized than when she 's not .
Correspondingly , lets take the case of a man who is studying to be a Social Entrepreneur .
In his line of work , issues of business management , information exchange , community development , field research etc are commonly addressed to solve socio-economic problems .
Hypothetically speaking , if his business is of distribution of Oncology / anti-retroviral drugs , then he 'd need to know generically about those too .
It will do his business and his credentials a world of good if he has both theoretical and practical knowledge of these issues on a broad basis , which impact the performance of his business .

Thus , the debate on whether specialization in academics is better or generalization , rests at the doorstep of the purpose of the academic pursuit .

"In my opinion , it is better to have specialization in one specific subject rather than having a broader knowledge of many academic subject .
I believe that a person should be a specialist rather than generalist .
There 's an old saying , `` Jack of all trades master of none . ''

Firstly , a person should not waste his time and money in acquiring knowledge which he wo n't require or use it in future .
A person should not devote his time in learning unnecessary subjects which he wo n't even imply in his specialization like Literature and Mathematics are two different fields .
None of the things are common between them .
Also , a mathematics student would waste his time and energy in learning literature whereas he could use this time to do reserach in his prefered subject .
This implies vice versa too .
There is no practical implementation of Mathematics in Literature .
We should avoid our time and energy spent on learning unnecessary subject .

Secondly , all the renowned people whether it is from literature or history or science are the people who have specialized in one subject .
They are not the people who have studied everything .
Infact , they are the people who have devoted all their life in specializing a subject .
They work day and night on their subject to come to certain conclusions which become the basis of our lives .
Moreover there are lot of prizes and recognition for the people who have specialized in one subject .
There is no such recognition for the people who know lot of subjects and are masters of none .
There is wealth , fame and recognition for the people who have dedicated their lives to specialize and reserach in their particular field .
These are the people who are highly appreciated and respected in our society .

Thirdly , most of the profession in today 's world requires a specialist .
We have software programmers , scientist , engineers and etc .
They all are the people who have mastered their field which is based on one subject .
This shows that a specialist can survive in any conditions .
He will always have jobs for earning his livelihood .
He will alway have a preference over others .

"Why does a person acquire knowledge ?
I would say , so that it can be used in living a better life , and if possible making that possible for others as well .
Which , then takes us to the question of which is better , a generalistic or specific .

I think the answer is , a mix of both .
It is really very difficult not to grow up acquiring a broad knowledge or understanding of various academic disciplines as we move up through school and college .
We do end up studying different subjects and that is good as it makes us aware of a whole lot of basic information etc. about so many fields of study that have close bearings on our lives .
It is also this stage that prepares us towards understanding what these various subjects deal with and consequently which we find ourselves interested in .
So , some amount of broad broad knowledge is generally built in to our academics .

However , specialisation in a particular subject also invariably happens at a later stage in college or university .
I think that in the world we are living in , it is more and more becoming essential to specialise in a subject so that you have market for your skills in the job market .
With the current levels of specialisation that the advances in science and technology has brought about in our work lives , it is nearly impossible to be very good at two things .
Not only have you to chose early in life whether you want to study medicine , enginering or music but you have to decide soon enough in your chosen stream what specialisations you are interested in .

If we take the example of the field of midicine , till two or three decades back , majority of the doctors start practicing as a generalist after an MBBS degree .
The ones who did go for a specialisation would generally chose from being a physician or a surgeon or gynaecologist and less then a dozen other specialistions .
But todays world of medicine has more than a dozen specialistions each for phisicians and surgeons .

To conclude , i would say that the world today belongs majorly to a specialist and hence the importance of specialising and in fact super specialising in a subject .
We however , should also realise the importance of having people with broad knowldege of things amonst us to fill in key places .

"Having a broader knowlege of many academic subjects helps a person to have a wider information of the things present in the vast world that he is lives in .
It keeps him aware of the facts and helps him deal with problems with a wider perspection .

On the contrary , specializing in one subject on a particular area keeps him localized and makes him narrow minded .
Furthermore , it makes him lose the self confidence while dealing with situations that come to him unexpectedly .
He feels enclosed and lost in this world of varieties .

For instance , I have a friend whose mother is a teacher and has studied History , Geography and English .
When I see her deal with the problems related any of these fields with complete easiness , it makes me feel that she is very confident of herself in whatever she does .
While I also know another teacher who has specialized in biology and has confined herself to the world of biology alone .
I completely agreethat it defintely is a difficult task studying a specific subject alone and specializing in it , however the advantages my friend 's mother has over her is obviously more in number .

Receiving a broad knowledge on a variety of topics does not mean specializing in it on studying for it .
It can also be achieved by mere reading .
This is one reason why we are adviced to read newspapers .
It helps us keep ourselves up dated with the incidents happening around us in this world .
Reading books or magazines or any piece of article for that matter doea not go vain .

Schools and colleges also include a variety of subjects for the students in their academic programs in order to make them self confident and train them to face the hardships and obstacles they will come across in their future life .

"Quite often management gurus thrust an age old aphorism , `` It 's better to be a jack of all trades , than a master of one '' .
Ofcourse , specialization is indeed beneficial , however , what 's needed to succeed in this cut-throat competitive world is not just depth but breadth of knowledge .
From my perspective , a broader knowledge base of many subjects is what I call for and agree with the statement .

If seen in the corporate context , a typical manager is required to know not just about his immediate area of interest or work , but also about the work assigned to colleagues and sub-ordinates alike .
For example , a building contractor , today is not just responsible for overseeing the construction part but also various other aspects such as dealing with artisans , wood craftsmen , masons , architect and many other such people , so as to accomplish the set goals wihin the stipulated timeframe .
Moreover , today students at school are taught how to balance their academic and co-curricular activities .
Why ?
Because , this inevitably involves growth and development and better and broader learning opportunities .

Gone are the times , when parents insited their kids on becoming a gynaecologist or a paediatrist or an optometrist and started grooming them at a very young age .
Medicals schools today churn out more general physicians than cardiologists and experts in other medical fields .
Admittedly , specialization in such fields in the form of Masters is indeed imperative , however , that happens mostly for a purpose of a job or a career to start with .

Furthermore , as people grow , learn and develop , a variety of skills will be needed to cope with abundant and rapidly changing knowledege and information , especially in this information age .

A broader skill base , is what even professional organizations ask for .
For them , it 's all a win-win situation in terms of more skills , responsibility and work load in the same cost as for a specialized person .
A CEO or an entrepreneur would n't have been what they are if they concentrated just on their area of expertise .
They are master strategists , skilled in various business aspects - finance , accounts , engineering , general management ( a course quite popular in B-schools ) .

"Well , according to me it depends on the real time situation .
Sometimes its better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one subject .
For example to make a living a person should be able to adapt himself in any kind of working atmosphere .
Suppose , Mr.X has done his graduation in say , chemical engineering , it does'nt guarntee him a job in chemical or any related industry cause its hard to get a job in the chemical industry as the number of employees required are fewer compared to the It industry .
If Mr.X has learnt basics about computer , which is usually thought in undergraduation school , then his chance of getting a job in a IT industry is more compared to chemical .
IT industry do require chemical engineers to deal with the clients related to chemical background and he can do a great job in understanding the problems of the client .
So , his broad knowledge about all his academics subject can get him a job .

One more example , lets talk about a paediatrician , a person ( doctor ) specialized to treat children problems .
Well he is much more familiar to diseases of a child than a grown up .
Suppose , he is travelling in a train , and suddenly there 's some problem to an accompaning passenger who is a grown up/elder person .
As a doctor his duty is to look at the problem of the person rather than saying i 'm a child specialist .
At this instance of time a broad knowledge on his academic subjects could help give a immediate initial remedy to the person before he is taken to a hospital .

At times you need to have specialization in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge about all his academic subjects .
For example a person specialized in nuclear engineering and working in a nuclear power plant .
Well , its a must to have a specialization in that one subject subject rather than having a broad knowledge about his other academic subjects like sugar technology , petroleum engg .. , etc. , Because he is responsible for the processes going on in the plant , and any problem can cause great havoc .
At this situation its worth to have a specialization in one subject .

What this proverb essentially implies is that it is not possible to attain mastery in several fields , one can only specialize in one .
The statement of the issue being discussed epitomizes a very paradoxical situation that we as human beings encounter throughout the course of our life i.e the path of mastery or the path of overall education .

It is often as a child you are asked the question : `` What do you want to be when you grow up ? ''
.
The child being ambitious and idealistic at the phase of his life would base his reply on his passion for a particular subject .
Well , it is true that most well educated human beings eventually settle down to choose a particular career based on their academic strength and prowess .
When pusuing a higher education we are made to choose a subject that we wish to major in and probably the subject that will encompass our career in the future .
We are forced to academically pusue a mastery in a particular field of life as this field shall play a vital role in determining our future , our social strength and our monetary power .
It will help in determining what we will be in the future of the socio-economic struggle among us , which evidently has become an essential part of our survival .
It is a fact , we need to attain mastery to build our success , we need to excel at something to prove our ability thus developing specialization in a particular axcademic subject is essential .

There is however , a counter-claim to this argument , a claim which defines the power of a well rounded , overall education .
Possessing a fundamental and broad knowledge in every walk of life and having an opinion on all matters .
A person who follows this ideal is a person whom i would define as a `` Jack of all trades '' .

Through my arguments I do not undermine the power of a well rounded academic back ground , what im trying to imply is that education is what is inculcated at the grass root levels .
Acquiring a broad knowledge of various academic fields is covered at the elementary and sub-secondary levels of education .
It is after this stage , that a human being has metamorphosized from this phase of his life into a phase which is ready for mastery , he is in a position to choose .
The options are always open in life , but it is our duty to choose and master the option that we most strongly believe in .
This is a trait that will help us stand out as the masters of our field and give us purpose in life .

"I would definetly disagree with the statement .
I say this because i am of the opinion that nobody is good at everything .
Students cannot cope up with the pressure of learning and handling such vastly diverse knowledge .

To have such a general base of knowledge with many subjects at once can bring in the effect of a student not being good at any of them .
I agree that there are cases where some exceptional students might be good at many subjects , but thats not the general case .
The general student can take only so much amount of knowledge .

I believe that one must learn aleast one thing perfectly rather than half-learn a hundred things .
In today 's world of highly advanced technologies there is too much information and knowledge to learn and it becomes hard for student to master even one subject perfectly .
Such being the case , a broad array of subjects will only increase the strain on the student , which may lead for him to get confused about the actual subject that he is really interested in .

For example , what good does a math student get from learning chemistry ?
It will only put him through a lot of strain to learn a thing which he really is n't interested in .

And i think it is really bad for students who have a focus in their life and have set goals to excel in a particular field , to have many academic subjects .
It will only bring down their enthusiam and zeal to learn more about their favourite subject .
And in events like when they fail to clear a subject which they dont like , they have to end up studying it all over again .
This only adds to their stress and delay in trying to study what they actually want to study .

Also , people who get the oppurtunity to learn what they rally like will definetly excel in it .
Their brains will work better for the subject they like .
And it will unfair to judge everyone by the same yardstick if we have many subjects .
I mean to say that while some people will be good at one subject they might fare really bad at the rest .
So u cannot have a common benchmark as such , to judge their talents .

"The topic at hand is whether it is better , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or detailed and specialized knowledge of one particular subject .
I feel that depending upon the scope of application of the knowledge of a person , the requirement can be broad or specific .
The reasons are as follows :

Certain professions for example that of a medical practitioner , requires him to have a broad based knowledge of the human body , the interliks between various parts and what effects a medicine for a particular disease could have on any otherbody part .

Software professionals on the other hand donot necessarily need to have broad based knowledge of the functioning of the computer or its parts .
For them a specialization in programming languages , web page designing etc is what is required .
Basically it is the application of the knowledge and using innovations that is important .
For the case of a doctor , the more he knows the better he applies the overall knowledge .

Then teachers of physical sciences for example need to have proper knowledge of subjects like physics , chemistry , mathematics , so that they are able to impart knowledge in a comprehensive way to the students and not poder over the doubts of the students .
A chemist or a molecular bilogist needs to have specialized knowledge on the specific fields , but less of other academic disciplines .

Students on the other hand need to have broad based knowledge upto a certain level of educaton wherein all those subjects are addressed to which may find application , though not in great detail ahead in his proffessional career or practical life .
After a certain level it depends upon the career path of the student , whether he chooses to specialize on a subject or increase his range of broad based knowledge .
Due to the endless ken of knowledge that could be accumulated , the nature of knowledge that could be possessed really depends upon the task at hand , the purpose for which it is required .

"People specialize in certain subjects because of many reasons , few of them may be person 's personal interest in that field , some times requirements are such that people have to specialize in certain subjects for good of other people for example specialization in heart surgery .
But its not always necessary to specialize in subjects .
People can learn and read many academic subjects as they like , but it has its own positive and negative sides .
But still according to me people should choose variety of subjects due to many possible reasons .

Firstly , many academic subjects provide people with broader way of thinking .
By choosing various academic subjects people can actually enhance and diversify their think tank .
They can use experiences of one subject to understand the other .
Variety of subjects can increase thier level of understanding in other areas also .
For example while studying for mechanical engines , students should also understand the chemical reactions taking place inside the engines and how they affect the working of engines .
This can only happen if they have enough information regarding chemical reactions inside the engine .

Secondly , by opting variety of subjects to study , students can become versatile .
They can view this world with wider range of options and with wider prospective .
For instance students may not face problems while applying for different types of jobs .
They can opt from variety of jobs available in the market in different fields .
Additionaly they can switch their careers later , if they want to , to try different jobs if they get bored from the previous one .

Admittedly certain jobs do require specialization in some fields , for instance technical jobs requiring surgery of particular body parts .
However people with diverse experience in various subjects are well respected and are very highly valued by the companies in the society .

Therefore i conclude that by studying various academic subjects people can really enhance their knowledge and can be a great value and asset to a company in which they are working .

"I would agree with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject '' I think it is wise to be a ` jack of all trades but may be master of none ' .
If one knows sufficient about many subjects but not everything about a particaular subject then he might not be able to top any subject but atleast he would not fail any of the subjects and if he performs reasonably ok in most then his overall performance would certainly be enhanced .
Also it is always helpful in daily life aswell as in terms of future prospects if one has a broad academic knowledge .
This would open him to far more career opportunities than if he limits his knowledge to only certain subjects .

Say for example , in high school , some one who has scored grade ` A ' in physics or mathematics while grade ` c ' in all other subjects , although may be able to get into a top class engineering university but would not have much other choices left incase he decides not to go for engineerin .
On the other hand , if one scores a ` B ' in most of his subjects he may not be able to get into the top class college but would certainly manage in a fairly good college and at the same time enjoy the liberty of having many career options to choose .

This also comes into play when one is applyinfg for jobs in future as the person having knowledge in various academic fields would find himself in a situation where he could apply in various institutions .

Also in place of his work , he might someday make use of his knowledge in other academic fields than what he is currently practicing , helping him handle a critical situation better and attain more success at work and a thus a brighter future ahead .

To summerise , knowledge never goes waste .
So its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Although exceptions might be there , as they always are , but in the long run it helps to have a broader spectrum of knowledge .

"I agree to have a speicalized knowledge on a specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
According to me , when a child is brought in a school and later to higher secondary school , he is taught all academic subjects which will lead him to a better understanding of this world .

After attending the school , a student has a broad perspect of different subject knowledge with him .
Now a student is capable of using his knowledge which leads to exploration of new ideas in his mind and setting a specific goal of his life .
The student thinks of a particular subject as his interest .
He develops a penchant for a particular subject .
It is in the interest of a student that he works for a specific subject because he will be a adroit and astute student of that subject .
A student therefore plans for his Masters in that subject .
He turns out to be a appropriate person for that specialized subject .
He later on joins research on that subject and he achieve his goal .
According to me , nobody in this world has capability to master every subject in this world .
Even scientists like Galileo , Einstein , Newton , etc. had their own interest and specialization which led to different discoveries in this world .
It implies that if everybody in this world have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects then world would be a boring place to stay .
There would be no innovation around and it would be tasteless .
The versatility of this world would end at its very early age .

There a so many living examples who has supported the idea of having a specialized knowledge on a specific subject .
From Sports to politics , Businessman to Adventurers , there so many people who lives their life for their dreams and their goals .
One of the best living example of my time is Mr. Amitabh Bachchan .
Amitabh bachchan is an actor of Bollywood Industry .
He has did his Bachelor in Arts and joined Bollywood Industry .
Recently , he has been awarded with the Bachelors of Performing Arts .
The ectasy which Amitabh bachchan would be having after achieving this degree would be immeasurable .
I support specialization on specific subject because its brings you immense happiness when you fulfill your goal of that subject .
Considering sports on the other hand , football legends like ronaldo , pele , ronaldinho have specialised in their skills and therefore they are at the peak of their career .

I would conclude by writing that specialization on a specific subject needs high interest in it and hard work to achieve the goals .
A person would achieve more fruitful if he is specialized in a specific subject than a person have a mere broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

"Knowledge is like an ocean the more deeper u go the more jewels you find .
we cannot say that at this particular point we know everything about a particular subject .
Learning is a continuous process .
The more we learn about one subject the more we discover about it .
I think its better to specialize in one specific subject .

In this rapid globalisation period everyone is required to be up to date .
The people who have surface knowledge about all the subjects find it difficult to survive in this competitive world .
Now a days every company require their employess to be specialized .
They need efficient work force which can solve specific problems and should also be flexible .
They should be able to deal with variety of situations but intially they are expected to deal with particular problem .
If we have broad knowledge about many acedemic subjects but if we do not know the subject which best suits our academic and job life then it will become quite difficult for us to have a bright career .

For example , let us suppose a case in which student does not know which subject he want to select for his major then he might keep on switching over the subjects .
He will not be able to concerntrate over any of the subject which will only waste his time .
Lastly when he will be called for interview , companies will not find him suitable for any specific postion .
After all a student who have studied computer science continously for two years will become a better programmer than a student who have studied many subjects like history , biology etc along with computer science .

Its not like that a student who has specialisation in any field will not be able to switch over other subject because a specialized person will be more effecient in learning things .
Its true that the person who have knowledge of every subjects will be more flexible but that does not mean underestimating the talent of specialized people .
Specialized people learn the things more accurately and fastly .
If in case they wants to switch over other career they can .
May be not easily as a person who already have knowledge about that field but will certainly learn it .

So , people should have broad knowledge of every subjects but they should also get specialization in one specific subject .
It will increase their caliber to work in crucial work situations and enhance their intellectual level .
After all the world is shrinking in a small room and is available on the single click of mouse then it requires both general as well as Specialised people for its development

"I completely agree with the statement that `` It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
Having a broad knowlege of many subjects will give a lot of exposure , new subjects will create interests and also provide better career prospects for students .

Students will gain a lot of exposure by studying many different subjects .
This will also prepare them to take classes in different departments .
I personaly feel that this is a very good option as this will make them interact with other students coming from different backgrounds as well gain valuable knowledge .

Moreover , studying a wide variety of subjects will help students develop new interests that they might eventually take up and make a career of it .
Let me support this with an example .

While I was studying `` Architecture '' we were asked to take a wide variety of subjects like Interior Design , Lanscaping , Theory of Structures , Humanities and History of Architecture .
While studying these subjects i developed a lot of interest in the subject of `` History of Architecture '' which eventually i went on to make a career in it .
Today I am working with the `` National Heritage Conservation Committee '' as a architect guiding the govenment about the various teachniques and means to protect the heritage and historical monuments .

Lastly this also creates better career prospects for students as a lot of prospective employers and firms want to recruit people who have a broad knowledge about a lot of subjects in their respective field .
As their knowledge tremendeously helps them in a lot of projects where such inputs are required and turn it into success !
For example a student with a broad Knowledge of `` Sustainable Design '' and Project Management will definately have an edge over a student with knowlege only in `` Interior design '' .

Thus it is important for students to have a broad knowledge of amny academic subjects instead of specializing in one specific one and I completely agree with it .

"Learning is a never ending process .
But it is very important for one to know `` How much to know '' .
Putting forth my disagreement for the statement i would like to present my opinion about the topic .
In my opinion having knowledge of many academic subjects is fairly justified to a very primary level , till the time one get 's to know the basics of that subject .
But it is very important to have detailed knowledge about one subject in particular .

To elaborate this point further i would like to detail the factor of ones aptitude that comes into play .
It is not necessary for a person to have strong affinity for a whole array of subjets than compared to a subject in particular .
This affinity can be potentially put to use by furher breeding ones liking for a paticular subject .
This can only be achieved by gaining detailed knowledge about that specific subject .

Lets take an example of a creative field like architecture , where the primary education that the syllabus provides gives one a rough idea about lots of subjects pertaining to history , evolution and practical implications of architectural design .
But the entire course focuses and deals with these subjects at a very primary level .

The amount of contribution a good architect can make to the society can be very crucial in defining the era a society comes from and to be in a position to make that level of contribution and has to have a very deep rooted understandng of the strata of society , the nature and behavorial pattern of people .
And this can be achieved only when ones understands the nuances of a subject in concern .
This not only provides a zest and encouragement to do better but can set examples for the comming generations .

This understanding has to be inculcated at a very nascent stage so that right decisions can be taken by individuals which broadens the horizons not only for ones personal development but could lead us into a refined and a resolved tommorow .

This situation would not have arised had he been an expert in other subjects as well .

Hence i am for the topic that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject .
Nobody can be perfect .
Learning is a process we have to undergo throughout our lives .
Nobody can succeed if he knows only a restricted source of information .
A person should hence plan what he is goin to learn during his core education years which begin for most people at highschool and continue throughout college .
Specialization is not a bad activity but it is not a smart decision to specialize in one subject at the cost of the others .

When speaking in public or even when talkin amongst friends for that matter woud n't it be great if one was filled with academic knowledge and intellectual odassity ?

Nowadays people are specializing in more than one subject .
Has anyone ever wondered why ?
All this is being done due to a change in thinking and a new approach of wider horizons and not a mental block that one should be efficient only in his or her related field of work .
A person can grow his worth by havin broader knowledge of various academic subjects as he will be able to tackle practical problems faced in life better his vast source of information and the large bank of knowledge he accumulated in his learning years .

The world is changing , the challenges are becoming greater , cut-throat competition is taking place nowadays and thus only the best of the best can survive in todays world where people are continously striving to reach higher in life .

If you specialize in only one subject your knowledge would be very confined and hence when you face the world out of the academic set up it would be difficult to adjust .
A specific example can be when you study management .
If in a management program you only expertise in Operations and have no knowledge of Finance you would have tough time when you have to work in Operations as it would involve parts of Finance .

Another example can be if you are studing history and do n't have any knowlegde about science you would face difficulty when you need to use science in history , for example , in radio carbon dating of fossils , and hence a knowlegde of science would be useful in such situations .

If you have broad knowledge of various subjects you become more flexible and can diversify in various different areas , while you choice becomes restricted if you are specializing in one particular subject .

Another aspect would be when you move into a business environment you would be considered a more fungilbe resource and hence you can fit in varous kinds of roles .

Broader knowledge about various subjects also broadens your horizons and helps develop integrative thinking in you .

In general the depth to which a subject is taught in academic institutes during specialisation may not be what you would require in normal business settings and hence this specialization would generally be not of much use in future unless you get into research etc .

Having a knowledge about a variety of subjects not only improve his intellectual power of thinking but will also improve his effficiency at work .
A person cannot succeed in his work if he does n't have thorough knowledge of his subjects .

Hardware part consists of all the mechanical systems including the couch and magnets and the software part consists of the computer system where imaces of the different parts of the body are acquired and saved for further evalution .
Now the hardware part is based on the engineering perspective and a requires a person to have a thorogh knowledge of it to operate the machine and should know the function of each part .
On the other hand software part requires a thorough knowledge of different softwares like the different languages used in the compiter then he should also be able to study the images .

In today 's complex world , each field or subject has become so complex that it requires more than a lifetime of dedicated effort to master that subject .
Unless one gives that effort , his knowledge about that field remains only superficial .

Specilization leads on to new frontiers .
Unless we have specialists in various fields , it will be very difficult to come up with new discoveries and inventions .
Each academic field has become so complex , it his highly improbable for a generalist today to come out with something new unless aided by chance or luck .

Specialization also leads to confidence in one 's personality .
If somebody is a specialist in his field , that person can be trusted to do that thing better than most people .
He can be expected to take responsibility related to that field , so that other people can focus on their own specialist fields .

Since a specialist is a master of his domain , he can pass on that information gained by investing time in one particular thing to the next generation .
A generalist wont have the depth and would not be appreciated by his audience when he talks about any of his various known topics .

There is no course in the world which gives degrees to students for having studied about 20 different fields .
All the degrees offered by colleges all over the world focus on one or two areas of specialization .
This itself proves the worth of specialization viz a viz general knowledge about various academic fields .

If one looks around , almost all the successful people are masters in their domain .
They know about one subject in detail and hence gain respect from their peers .

"I Disagree with the statement .
I BELIEVE THAT IT IS BETTER TO SPECIALIZE IN AN AREA THAT TO BE FAMILIAR TO A WHOLE LOT OF ACADEMIC SUBJECTS .

My response is based on an experience that speeks for itself .
Being from an engineering background i was faced with a similar situation where i needed to choose between a spealized course of INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ( IT ) and a general stream of computer science which also includes IT .
I would rather be good at one thing than know about a wide range of areas .
So I took IT .
Now i can proudly say that I specialize in IT n get a brilliant job rather than saying that I know about many areas n settle for an average job .

Similar case where doctors after doing MBBS have to specilize in a stream to be successful .
Suppose a person is just MBBS .
He knows about every part of the body but doesnot know how to handle a patient who urgently needs a heart surgery .
This again puts light on the topic where specializing counts a lot .
In this specific case it could mean life or death for the patient .

When a person is good at a certain area he/she can persue a career in that stream .
Everyone has likes and dislikes for subjects .
No one can say that he/she likes all areas of the academic curriculum .
Thus the person must persue the area which they are most interested in and specialize in it .
This will not only make him/her happy but also keep others happy .
And the person is most likely to do well by studying something they are keen on .

On the other hand the person who is jack of all trades is most likely to be unhappy n make people around him unhappy by not being good at what he/she is doing .

Though a general knowledge about basic subjects is essential the indepth knowledge of specific subject is mostly required .

The curriculum of a school is so devised as to teach the growing child the basic subjects like english , science , mathematics , social studies , moral education and so on .
As the child grows a stage comes when he has to choose the subject he would like to specialize .
In college the students are required to opt for a subject as their major area of study .
He has to choose his career .
Nobody would disagree that there is not much of use of literature and economics if a person wishes to be a doctor or other science major .
Similarly the persons opting for business need not care about studying biology .

Being a medical graduate I understand that today the world is in favour of specialist .
A person if he has contracted a disease goes first to his general practitioner who tries to manage the case but if the case is not recovering with his treatment he refers it to a specialist .

The specialist sometimes may face problem as he has to deal with a case who has disease in many organ systems thus he has to take the help of other specialists .

"I believe that it is better for people to have broad understanding of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because a wide scope of knowledge in various academic subjects is required for multi-tasking , for maturing into a knowledgeful person , and for conducting specific tasks efficiently .

Firstly , due to the changes in the business enviornment , employees are required to carry out various tasks at which they may not have specialized .
For instance , a business manager is required to facilitate stratergy formations which requires an understanding of various subjects such as finance , accounts , operations and human resource .

Secondly , knowledge is a vital component for a person to mature .
Maturity does not come only from age and wisdom but also from an understanding of various topics that may not be necessary for fulfilling the tasks in a job description .
For instance , a person needs to have an understanding of biology and chemistry to either consume over-the-counter medicines or prescribe them to thier relatives .
The very same person could be working as a receptionist at an hotel where no information on chemistry or biology would be required to fulfill the tasks in the job description .

Lastly , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help an inidivual to conduct a specific task more efficiently .
For example , a marketing manager will be required to be knowledgeable about technology , finance , and accounts in order to form marketing plans and budgets .
Without the knowledge about these subjects , the marketing manager will not be able to complete his or her task efficiently .

"The topic state that `` It is better to have knowledge of a number of academic subjects than having specialization in one specific subjects '' and I tend to disagree .
The reason for taking this stand is this - although education systems through out the globe support both the modes of study yet a specialist is any ways prefered over a person who is a kind of `` jack of all trades '' .

Before going into depth let me remind you about a normal prcedure of education these days .
When a child goes to school then in order to make him acquainted with all things in the surrounding , he is tought a variety of subjects .
Later on , in his teens , he is taught the basic of all the major streams , so that he can choose his major .
Finally , this all goes in the direction of choosing one subject , and all the subjects are touched so that he can find out the flow of his interests .

Now lets talk about `` Specialization '' .
The specialzation is required for depth knowledge of a subject .
To work over a subject you always need that and all the subjects ( available for major ) are having enough depth to spend your life working on it .

I remember one very well said line `` Practice makes a man perfect '' .
In the same way a specialists is always having his concentration at a subject and is working out with that subject all the time in order to get best results for the well-fare of the society .

Here , I can also take example of myself .
What would I do in case I get a heart problem ?
I would definetly go to a heart specialist .
The similar situation can be applied in all the problems you encounter in your life .

Its true a basic knowledge of each and every subject is required to sustain your life without getting stucked at every other hurdle that comes but broad knowledge of many academic subjects will make life a mess .
You would not be able to comentrate on one thing .

Hence , I would always prefer going for a specialization instead of mugging my head in a number of subjects at a time .

"The question here is that is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specilaze in one subject .
In my view it is better to specialize in one subject only .
I have sufficient reasons and examples to support my claim .

Firsltly , although it is better to have a broad knowledge about many academic subjects , but this is only useful upto a certain extent only .
It is always better to specialize in one specific subject because it gives you right confidence and Knowledge to make a substantial contribution to your field .
Consider a nuclear scientist working on a project , although it is necessary for him to have knowledge of thermodynamics , fluid sciences etc. but it is his specialization in the field of nuclear engineering that makes him suitable for the job .
Moreover the reasearch projects are carried out in team where people who specialize in different fields come together and execute the project , so there is no need to have deep knowledge of all the fields .

Secondly , in some cases having a broad knowledge of many subjects does not serve the purpose .
For instance in medical field , we have doctors who specialize in everything from toe to ears .
This is really necessary as only a cardiologist can do justice to a heart patient rather than a physician , who only knows a bit of everything but is incapable of providing doing proper prognosis and diagnosis .
So this shows it makes sense to specialize only in one field .

Finally , almost every individual from his childhood has a field of interest , one subject which he likes the most .
It is a known fact people perform the best when they work on the field which interests them .
There is very high probabilty that individual will contribute favorably to the society .

As the saying goes Jack of all trades , master of none , this era demands specialists and not jacks .

It helps him in choosing his career .

I believe that specialization in a specific field is better than to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects .

Firstly specializing in a particuar subject gives you an in-depth understanding of the subject .
It helps in understanding of the finer details .
Careers can be built in that particular subject of interest .
Like doctors do masters in a particular field eg : cardiology , pathology etc .
Then they can treat patients having particular disorders like the cardiologists treating heart patients .
They can concentrate on one thing and really become a pro at that .

Secondly specializing give an in-depth knowledge ofthe subject .
One can reasearch an a particularly interesting topic and probably invent something in it .
It gives an added edge to the person .
Moreover it develops the person 's interest into it .
Like after learning about networking it really increased my interest in the different types of protocols of networking etc .
If given a chance I would really like to work in that field .

"A broad knowledge of many academic subjects would provide breadth of knowledge .
As against this , specialization in one specific subject would provide depth of knowledge .
In my opinion , a person should obtain a broad knowledge of many academic subjects while pursuing undergraduate studies and must specialize in one specific subject while pursuing post graduate studies .

Undergraduate studies are generally undertaken by students in the formative years of their life .
If at this crucial juncture , a student is not given an opportunity to explore a variety of areas , his learning process may be stinted .
If a student is encouraged to study many academic subjects , he will be able to decide his area of interest .
Further , he will understand the interdependence and interrelatedness of different academic subjects .
Pursuing many academic subjects would help the student to obtain a functional knowledge in all the subjects he studies .
Such a strategy would prove to be useful as the student will have flexibility of choice , when it comes to choosing his subject of specialisation .
For example if a student is pursuing graduation in finance , by studying banking , corporate finance and equity research , he will get a functional knowledge of all the areas in finance .
He may choose courses in banking or equity research while pursuing his post graduate studies .

Post graduate studies are undertaken by students who have completed their graduate courses .
Post graduate studies equip a student with specific skills that the student will need , when he seeks employment .
A person cannot be `` A jack of all trades , but a master of none '' .
Hence it is advisable for a student to choose one specific subject of his liking and specialize in it .
This would help him acquire expertise and mastery over one specific subject .
If a student were to study only one course in his undergraduate studies , say for example corporate finance , he may not be able to understand the effect of banking on corporate finance .
On the contrary , if the student has dwelved in corporate finance and banking in his undergraduate studies , he will be able to correlate the impact that banking has on corporate finance .

The statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is a complex and subjective one. While it may seem that young individuals have the advantage of vitality, energy, and fewer responsibilities, the idea that they inherently enjoy life more than their older counterparts is not necessarily accurate.

Young people often have the luxury of time and freedom to explore new experiences, pursue their passions, and engage in spontaneous activities. However, does this automatically equate to a higher level of enjoyment? Can we overlook the depth of wisdom, contentment, and gratitude that can come with age and experience?

Older individuals may have faced hardships, losses, and challenges that have shaped their perspective on life. Their enjoyment may stem from quieter moments of reflection, meaningful connections with loved ones, and a sense of fulfillment from a life well-lived. Can we dismiss the richness of these experiences in favor of the exuberance of youth?

Moreover, the idea of enjoying life is highly individualized and subjective. What brings joy to one person may not necessarily resonate with another. It is essential to recognize that enjoyment can take many forms and evolve over time.

In conclusion, the notion that young people inherently enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to capture the complexity of human experience.

"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. While it is true that young people may have more energy and enthusiasm due to their youth, older individuals often have a deeper appreciation for life and its experiences.

One reason why older people may enjoy life more is because they have accumulated wisdom and life experiences that shape their perspective. They have gone through various challenges, successes, and failures, which have taught them valuable lessons and helped them appreciate the small moments in life. For example, an older person who has gone through hardships may find joy in simple things like spending time with loved ones or enjoying a beautiful sunset.

Moreover, older individuals tend to have more stable relationships and a stronger sense of self-awareness, which can contribute to their overall happiness and enjoyment of life. They have had time to cultivate meaningful relationships, pursue their passions, and find fulfillment in their accomplishments. For instance, an older person who has built a successful career or raised a family may derive immense satisfaction from their achievements.

In conclusion, while young people may have a more carefree attitude and a sense of adventure, older individuals often have a deeper understanding of life and a greater capacity for gratitude and contentment. Age does not determine one's ability to enjoy life; it is the mindset, experiences, and relationships that shape one's perception of happiness and fulfillment.",P2,HIN,high,1
"I believe that the statement claiming young people enjoy life more than older people is not entirely accurate. While it is true that young individuals often have more energy, enthusiasm, and a sense of adventure, enjoyment of life is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person regardless of age.

Young people may have fewer responsibilities and more opportunities for new experiences, but they also face challenges such as uncertainty about the future, pressure to succeed, and societal expectations. On the other hand, older individuals may have more stability, wisdom, and a deeper appreciation for life's simple pleasures. They may find joy in spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies they are passionate about, or simply enjoying a quiet moment of reflection.

Furthermore, life experiences shape one's perspective and ability to find happiness in different ways. Older people may have developed resilience and a greater sense of gratitude through overcoming obstacles and setbacks over the years. They may find joy in the little things that young people may take for granted.

In conclusion, age alone does not determine the level of enjoyment one experiences in life. Both young and older individuals have unique opportunities and challenges that contribute to their overall happiness and fulfillment. It is essential to recognize that enjoyment of life is a personal and individual experience that transcends age boundaries.",P2,HIN,high,1
"As a seasoned individual who has experienced the various stages of life, I have come to believe that the notion of young people enjoying life more than older people is not entirely accurate. While it may seem that young people have the advantage of youth and vitality, older individuals possess a wealth of knowledge, perspective, and appreciation for life that can lead to a deeper sense of enjoyment.

Young people often experience life with a sense of naivety and impulsiveness, seeking thrills and new experiences without fully understanding the consequences. On the other hand, older individuals tend to savor the small moments, find joy in simplicity, and have a greater understanding of what truly matters in life. They have learned to appreciate the beauty of everyday moments, the importance of relationships, and the value of time.

For instance, my grandmother, in her late 70s, finds joy in spending time with her loved ones, gardening, and reading a good book. She exudes a sense of contentment and fulfillment that is a result of a life well-lived and cherished moments accumulated over the years.

In conclusion, while young people may have a different kind of enjoyment in their lives, older individuals also find immense pleasure in the wisdom, memories, and relationships they have cultivated over time. It is not a matter of one group enjoying life more than the other, but rather a different perspective and appreciation for what life has to offer at different stages.",P2,HIN,high,1
"Title: The Ageless Enjoyment of Life: Debunking the Myth of Youthful Bliss

It is a common belief that young people enjoy life more than older individuals. But do age and enjoyment have a direct correlation? While it may seem that youth is synonymous with carefree days and boundless joy, I argue that the enjoyment of life is not limited by age.

Firstly, young people often face numerous challenges and uncertainties as they navigate the complexities of adulthood. The pressure to succeed academically, establish a career, and build relationships can weigh heavily on their shoulders. Do these responsibilities contribute to a sense of carefree enjoyment?

Conversely, older individuals may have more life experience and wisdom to draw upon, leading to a deeper appreciation for the present moment. With age comes the ability to savor the simple pleasures in life, such as a quiet morning coffee or a leisurely walk in nature. Can these moments of contentment be considered less enjoyable than the fleeting thrills of youth?

Moreover, older individuals often have a greater sense of gratitude for life itself, having weathered the storms of adversity and learned to cherish each day as a precious gift. Is this profound sense of gratitude not a form of enjoyment in itself?

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with exuberance and vitality, the enjoyment of life transcends age boundaries. Both young and old alike have the capacity to find joy in the beauty of everyday moments and the richness of human connections.

"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. While it is true that youth is often associated with vitality and excitement, older individuals have a wealth of life experiences and wisdom that can bring a deeper sense of enjoyment and fulfillment.

Older people have had the opportunity to learn from their past experiences, make peace with their mistakes, and cultivate meaningful relationships over time. This emotional maturity allows them to appreciate the simple joys of life, such as spending time with loved ones, enjoying nature, and pursuing hobbies they are passionate about. In contrast, young people may be more focused on the pressures of establishing their careers, relationships, and identities, which can sometimes overshadow their ability to fully savor the present moment.

Moreover, older individuals often have a greater sense of gratitude for each day they are given, having witnessed the passage of time and the fragility of life. This awareness can lead to a profound sense of contentment and appreciation for the small pleasures that life has to offer.

In conclusion, while youth may bring energy and excitement, older individuals have a unique perspective on life that allows them to find joy in the everyday moments. Both age groups have their own set of challenges and opportunities for enjoyment, but it is the depth of experience and wisdom that comes with age that can truly enhance one's ability to savor the richness of life.",P2,HIN,high,1
"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. While it may seem that young individuals have more energy and fewer responsibilities, the idea that they inherently enjoy life more is flawed. 

Firstly, older individuals have accrued a wealth of life experiences that have shaped their perspectives and allowed them to appreciate the little things in life. They have learned to find joy in simplicity, cherish meaningful relationships, and savor moments of peace and contentment. This depth of understanding and gratitude for life's nuances often surpasses the superficial enjoyment that young people may experience.

Moreover, as people age, they tend to prioritize their well-being, both physically and mentally. Older individuals often place a higher value on self-care, mindfulness, and personal growth, leading to a more profound sense of fulfillment and happiness. In contrast, young people may be more prone to seeking instant gratification and fleeting pleasures, which may not contribute to long-term happiness.

They have had the opportunity to learn from their past experiences, develop meaningful relationships, and gain a better understanding of what truly brings them joy.

Moreover, older individuals often have more financial stability and can afford to indulge in activities that bring them happiness, such as travel, hobbies, or spending quality time with loved ones. They may also have more free time to focus on self-care and personal growth.

On the other hand, young people may face the pressures of establishing their careers, navigating relationships, and finding their place in the world, which can be stressful and overwhelming at times.

"Title: The Perception of Enjoying Life: A Comparative View of Young and Older Individuals

The idea that young people enjoy life more than older individuals is a topic that sparks debate. Some argue that the carefree nature and sense of adventure associated with youth lead to a more enjoyable life, while others contend that older individuals have a deeper appreciation for life's nuances. Where do I stand on this issue?

It is undeniable that young people often possess a boundless energy and eagerness to explore new experiences. Their zest for life can be infectious, leading to moments of pure joy and excitement. However, does this necessarily equate to a greater enjoyment of life? 

On the other hand, older individuals may have a more nuanced understanding of what brings true happiness. Their life experiences have likely taught them the value of relationships, personal growth, and finding contentment in simple pleasures. Could this deeper sense of fulfillment be considered a form of enjoying life to its fullest?

Moreover, as individuals age, they may have the financial means and stability to pursue activities that bring them joy, whether it be traveling, pursuing hobbies, or spending quality time with loved ones. Does this ability to enhance their quality of life through these experiences suggest that older individuals can enjoy life just as much, if not more, than their younger counterparts?

In conclusion, the perception of enjoying life is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. While young people may exude a sense of vibrancy and excitement, older individuals bring wisdom and a deeper appreciation for life's subtleties.

"In my openion young people do enjoy life more than older people .
This is a very evident fact and can be said based on reasons .

Firstly , Younger people have more risk taking and dander facing tendancy than older people .
Young people are carefree and more enthuziastic than older people and hence they tend to perform any activity for just the sake of enjoyment .
While older people do not have that carefree and risk taking attitude .
Older people are much mature and tend to focus more on the danger and possibility of damage or accident that lays ahead .
So , younger people many times enjoy themselves by taking up risky sports like car and motor-bike racing , bungy jumping and para-sailing .

Secondly , the phsical conditions of older people does not many times allow them to move to different places and perform many fun related activities .
While the body of younger people is more flexible and strong so they get less tired .
So , they can enjoy by taking up sports , long country tour and other similar activities as a source of enjoyment for themselves .
Also , young people are more flexible an adaptable towards the changes in the culture and in technology and hence more by going to a disco , pub , getting tattoos , playing games on computer and using various eletronic items like i-pods and mp3 player .

Lastly , though it is possible for older people to enjoy life but they are not able to enjoy as much as younger people due to other limitations .
Older people have many responsibilities of family , work and society on them .
So , they are not able to enjoy themselves as much as young people who are free from these responsibilities and have much more time to enjoy .

Therefore , it can be said that due to carefree , flexible and risk taking nature of young people it is possibe for them to enjoy more than the adults who are less flexible and have much more responsibilities on themselves .

"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .
This is very evident when we go to see some sports or carnivals or even a club .
More often we find very active and enthusiastic participation of the youth .
Old people generally do not get interested in new things as easily .
New things do not invibe the same level of excitement in old people as it does to the youth .
Many reason can be given for this difference in the way of looking at life between old people and youth .
Young people at their stage are still exploring new things in their life .
Every thing excites them .
Nothing is usual for them .
A base ball match may be just another match for an old man but for a youth it may be very important .
He gets involved into it much more and hence enjoys it more too .

After a certain age life becomes mundane , every thing seems to be routine .
People get used to a very fixed kind of life .
Small events which ones full filled them with joy seem to be just another thing .
One reason could be the coming of stagnation in one 's life after a certain age .
We get bound by a lot of things after getting old .
We refuse to being dynamic .
Relationships become stagnant , we stop thinking of growth even in our jobs and all these things reduces the interest towards life .
Wherease someone who is young , say a fresh graduate there is so much unstability in his life which inturn gives his life more dynamism .
This keeps his life more interesting and hence he enjoys life more .

Health aspects can be another reason why young people have more fun .
Young people are more healthy and spirited .
For an enjoyable and fullfilling life good health is very important .
In old age , people generally become weak and lose their health too .

This prevents them from enjoying their life fully .
All the above reasons results in youth people being able to enjoy life more than the older ones .

"Young people surely enjoy life more than older people do .
There are various reasons to support this opinion .
Firstly , young people have more energy and vitality than older people who may suffer from various ailments and may become less physically active as they age .
Youth , with all its energy provides a chance for various adventures and possibilties .
This may be one of the reasons why younger people outnumber older ones in adventure sports and other thrilling and sometimes potentially dangerous fun activites .

Secondly , younger people may have lesser responsibilties than their older counterparts because of absence of dependents like spouse and children .
Hence they dont need to take many factors into account or compromise when doing or pursuing an activity or vocation of their choice .

Thirdly , young people have more opportunities and less obligations and are more inclined to venture into unexplored areas and innovate .
They may be ready to take calculated risks if it helps in their growth and advancement .
Though this may sound as being less responsible , but a person only grows when he moves out of his comfort zone .

Also , older people may be less flexible and less open to change even if it is for their own good .
While young people are open to new ideas and willing to try them .
The excitement , enthusiasm and openess to explore a young person brings to the table is unmatchable .

Hence , it can be averred that young people are able to enjoy life more than their older counterparts .
Else , why would everyone want to retain youth forever or why no one in this world ever wants to get older ?

"I disagree to the statement that young people enjoy their life more , as the older people were also young at some point of their life and hence they have gone through what a younger generation is going through , but time plays an important role in the enjoyment of life and also what an individual has the image of enjoyment of life in his mind .

Firstly , it is correct that young generation is enjoying the life more than the older at that time but as the time passes the young generation has to enter the older generation and that same young generation now again takes some pleasures in enjoying life in older age also thus if we calculate the enjoyment by comparing the older person to young one then we will find that older ones has enjoyed more on the scale of time .

Secondly , every person has its own defination of enjoyment in life , some might feel like their are enjoying life if the go for long drive or spend time in travelling and exploring the huge world , while some might feel that they are enjoying thier life by just chilling around their loved ones and spending time in chatting , emailing playing games etc. now this type of enjyoment are not defined for some particular age any one can get this enjoyment at anytime of thier life .
Thus the older and younger genration can enjoy to the same type of enjoyment .

Thirdly , every person has his own set of thinking of enjoyment and as the young generation is unaware of enjoyment he is going to get in his future life , he is more excited and ready to enjoy the life at every part of his life , which was the same feeling that an old generation has gone through .

Moreover now all the enjoyment that a young genration does are aslo tried and enjoyed by the older people , thus they have present life of enjoyment in old age and also had the enjoyment during thier young age , but the current younger genration ca n't go back in time and enjoy the moments that the older generation has experienced , but will have some different experiences of enjoyment of life for their coming younger generations .

Also , even if the young generation is young and can do many things that older ca n't but there are some things that younger genration does not have is the experience of the enjoyment which had been to the older generation , for young generation the enjoyment has just begin but for the older one it is coming to its end and thus they have far more enjoyed than the current younger generation .

Thus altogether the younger generation also enjoyes the life but the enjoyment that he has experienced has also been experieced by the older genration and the defination of enjoyment changes from person to person .

Young people have much more capacity and streangth than older people to enjoy life and also the younger generation in todays world is fully pampered by the older generation .

"The statement here states that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe this depends on how you percieve life as .
Everyone has his own opinion about life .
According to me young people enjoy life more than old people do .
We will discuss more on this in the following passages .

Firstly , young people have an advantage of their age to do a lot of things that old people are restricted to .
When you are young your body is more flexible and supportive to get moulded in any kind of conditions .
And you can work as hard as you can , you can go for night outs at college or at work , you can stretch your working schedule as much as you want but the same is not true with old people .
In old age your body becomes weak and unsupportive to harsh conditions .
A classic example would be life at college campus .
Young students are seen to be pro-active in studies as well as in extra-curricular activities .
They tend to enjoy a lot , do a lot of things in a lesser time and at a faster pace .
Old people cannot do this kind of work at their age .

Secondly , when you are young you have so many things unexplored in life which keeps you enthusiastic and interested in life .
So as young people work harder and achieve their goals and experiences in life they get a lot of satisfaction and hence a lot of enjoyment .
Apart from work the youngsters are also keen towards love and romance in life which plays a major role in enjoying life with a partner .
Even the body at young age is very good for romancing and enjoying .

Lastly , though old people are usually settled and have a quite good money to spend they can enjoy a lot of wealthy things .
They also have a lot of leisure time to spend and enjoy life .
But since body basics are not the same as young age and they do n't have much to do in life because of many restrictions such as health problems or some disease or problems like cannot exert body much and so they cannnot enjoy life much .

To sum it up , young people see and experience a lot many things in life than the old people at their stage , as old people had already went through these stages and does not have much to do .

Young people have a lot of freedom and interest in doing things .
So as per the views and examples expressed above I believe young people enjoy life more than old people do .

Young people live it more lively and older people live it in a more plain way within their physical limits , but they woud have lived it lively when they were young .

I agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more as compared to older people .
Young people are more energetic and more ambitious in their youth .
They have the desire to bring sky down .
Young people have the quality of persistence that is to keep trying to achieve their goal .
This ability of theirs helps them to enjoy life and face all the hardships whatever comes on their way .
For eg. : Youths always try new methods of entertainment which is full of dangers and risks .
Like Bungee Jump , car race etc .
Young people are always open to new ideas and they have the desire to explore the world .
They implement new thoughts in teir way of living and enjoy life to the full .

At the same time old people are not able to enjoy more in life .
They spend most of the time in the memories of what they did in their young age .
They are even not physically fit to do all the activities which a youth can do .
In the old age the ability of persistence reduces .
Old people dont have the desire to compete with the world to get the best .
They always remain happy in what they have and in the way how they live .
They are never open to new modern ideas and are not able to enjoy life as compared to youths .

Finally i would like to say that , i am not against the old people .
These are the people when young developed new ideas which the youg generation of this age is following and enjoying .

"Life is a series of experiences .
These experiences start from birth till life ends .
If a series of experiences are enjoyable , we percieve that part of our life as good .
If we went through a series of bad experiences , we percieve our life to be dull & bad .
Thus , the degree of enjoyment one encounters in life is a result of the quality of the sum of series of experiences one had in a lifetime .

I disagree to the statement , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I strongly believe that the degree of enjoyment one experiences in life is dependent on various factors , the most important being one 's own mental-set .
For example : An old man woud rather be enjoying more , playing with his/her grandson than the grandson him/herself .

So , enjoyment is not based on age .
It is one 's own mind set & its ability to percieve things positively & appreciate them .
In turn it will result in an enjoyable experience .
Living life enjoyably is a skill .
It has to be learnt , either through experience or through knowledge .

The young people assume partying , going out with friends , seeing movie are the great enjoyments that they are experiencing .
But they are least exposed to the fact that these are only traces of happinees , just like bubbles on the water surface .
There are deeper , intense & more joyful moments in life .
The emotional happiness of spending lifetime with a partner is one of the deep enjoyments older people go possess .

With age comes maturity & stability to withhold happiness .
The experiences of life also provide the much wanted tolerance to older people .
This makes them a better knower of life , relationship & how to derive happiness from it .

In my opinion an older person is a better taster of different kinds of enjoyments in life .

Young people can enjoy all the entertainment in the world whereas the older people would have to think twice before doing anything .
Young people can play sports such as soccer , tennis , baseball and the list goes on whereas the body of older people dont permit them to take part in these activities .

Young people can travel around the world and see ther different cultures of different countries whereas older people dont have the stamina and will to travel so much .
Young people can try and find ways to increase their standard of living by working and doing jobs whereas older people have no choice but to live the rest of their lives in the same way .
The young people go to clubs and bars and make new friends whereas old people just sit at home and probably watch television .

The social life for the young people is much more than that of the old people .
Young people can do all sorts of adventures like rock climbing , sky diving or bungy jumping .
These things are totally restricted for the old people .
The young people are much more excited and energetic than old people .
The young ones look forward to the upcoming days and events whereas old people just gaze around at their homes lazily and have no future plans .
The young people have future aims and goals in life but the older ones have already lived thier goals and dont look forward to anything in the future .
Young people have all the time in the world to gain fame or earn money whereas the older ones are almost through with thier lives and dont bother about fame or money .

Finally , I would like to conclude by saying that the young people can dream big and then take steps to achieve their dream but as for the old people go , they might have dreamt of something big and some of them might have even converted those dreams into reality , but now they can only dream about thier past and recall thier beautiful moments of the early times .

"I potentially disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
First , what i feel is that it 's not the age which determines the level of pleasure or enjoyment in life .
It 's basically our attitude toward life which enables us to take the maximum out of what life has to offer .
Our outlook towards life is the determining factor for the parameters that we set for enjoying life .

Secondly , its a matter of committment and perception that wins us points in the game of life .
For example , an old person having an optimistic approach toward everthing what life has to offer would rather enjoy stressless leisurely evenings sitting in the garden or maybe gardening .
In contrast to this a young man having more than half of his life to live could be sitting on a chair in the same very garden and cursing his fate for providing hinderances in his path to success .

Thirdly , it may be assumed that the younger part of life or the youth age demands more of you but it does n't mean that a young man simply cannot enjoy his life because he is has more work / assingments to complete .
It 's a function of mind games that determines individual perception and it is this perception that fuels us to look towards life in a different plain altogether .
I have seen old people like my grandmother enjoy trekking and mountaineering .
History , like all other examples incorporates one in these terms too .
We 've had scientist who were old enough to be counted out as non-exciting in general view but but active enough to invent some of the most exciting things on earth .

Lastly , the fact that the body may be old enough but it is our mind and will power that combine together to give us a rush of adrenaline even at the age of 70 .

Youngsters have no or very less responsibilities regarding there financial independance and taking care of their family however , they have lots of other things going on in their lives .
They have to make important decisions regarding their career and studies .
They face lot of prolems like changing levels of maturity , meeting new people , concentrating on so many things at the same time e.g. sports , arts , academics etc .
So , it will not be fare to think that youngsters enjoy their lives because they do n't have much to think about seriously .
However , it is the way they take their life and respond to their problems .
They try to cope up with their problems without actully thinking a lot about it , that means they just do it ...
without giving it a thought later on , whether it was right or wrong ?

On the other hand , most of the older people are usually spending lot of time thinking about their problems or about their wrong decisions in the past .
They have a sense of responsibility for their family and young ones , all the time even if they could do a little to solve their problems .
They think that age is a barrier for them to be happy and enjoy their life .
They stop going out for parties and meetig other people as they believe that they are too old for all these things .

"I am in the agreement with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older eople do .
When young , every individual has the energy , zeal , passion and strength to enjoy the life .
Its the exuberance of youth that always motivates one towars more colorful side of life and thats what lack in the older people .
In the age of teen , every individual has a desire to experience the life to the fullest .
he aims high to achieve his goals .
He studies hard to get into a good university .
After getting enrolled , he plans well and again studies hard with great perseverance to get a good score and finally a degree that will provide him the platform to move further ahead in life .
After he gets a satisfactory job or starts some business , he wants to settle in life with a loving and caring spouse .
Taking responsibilities and standing by them gives him the immense pleasure of being successful .
So he is always in process of making life better .
When he is 30 to 35 , he plans for his kids , their schooling , their upbringing in a better environment .
And as the time passes he becomes weak and old , not strong enough to take care of his family .
Rather he becomes dependent on his children for his small needs .
Surrounded with health troublems , he rarely get anytime for enjoyment .
But not neglecting those special exceptional cases that justifies the quote `` your age is what you feel '' .
A well planned and organised life can definitely expircate the weekness of oldage .
Neglecting the negatives aspects of oldage , if one loks towards the postive facade , its the oldage that makes the life complete .
Older people do enjoy life with their grandkids , friends , betterhalves , livelyness of the gardens in which they stroll and many more .

"It is commonly said that , even if you get old remain young at heart .
This is because young enjoys every bit of life , when they are working , playing , partying or even when they are wasting their time .
Youth represents eneregy , flow , ability to work hard and party harder .
Therefore , I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

At young age , people have dreams , aims , hopes and ability to fulfill their dream .
This encourage them continously to work hard and acheive their goal .
At young age , they enjoy this hard work .
while older people do it for its sake .
For them , it is routine and nothing inspiring is left in doing those thing .
They are just cutting the time .

At the time of party , youth enjoys it even harder , as it is the outcome of their hard work .
They tend to flirt , dance , drive , eat and drink .
This gives them an complete experience , which the old can never enjoy .
Being old , you cannot flirt or dance , and limitations come on eating and drinking due to health problems .
Also , they are in continous tensions , for variety of reasons .
This make their life boring .

At young age , you have friends of various interests .
This helps you to take part in each and every game .
You can go for rock climbing , sea diving , underwater swimming , Formula racing and even to various other sporting events .
But as you grow old , your stamina decreases , you are sorrounded by various illness , energy level has decreased a lot .
All this factors lead you to keep out of such sporting events .

In my country , people are always thinking of other 's view and opinion .
This inhibits their desire to break all the rules and become young once again .
Wheras young do n't give a penny to such things .
They enjoy life in full stretch .
They do not care for other 's opinion and do as they want , which is also a prerequisite of enjoyment .

There is also othet part of coin .
Young people want to live life happily , without a break .
So , if something unwanted happen , they get depressed very easily .
At this stage , youth require experience of older people to fight this depression .
If the young learn to avoid depression and understands thats up and downs are part of life they can easily come over any situation and enjoy life non stop .

Thus , it can be easily concluded that , if you want to enjoy life you have to become young again .
It is not that older people do n't enjoy but when they enjoy we seldom says that they had return to their young age .

This is enough to say that young people enjoy a lot .

"Different people have different views as to how they spend their life and what they weant to persue .
As time moves on , these goals and behaviours also change with the mindset and lives of people .
It is necessary for people to be able to live their age .
For example a high school student 's priority would be do excell in his studies and do well in school whereas a businessman 's would be to ensure he earns as much money he can .

The main difference between the people above in the example is that where one is a sixteen year old kid , the other is a thirty-five year old who probably has a family to support .
That does not mean that they live only for those things .
They live life the way they are supposed to , accordingly to their responsability .
Young people comparatively do n't have much to worry about and can enjoy themselves at a discotheque or play sports or what they are able to do .
Older people can indulge in more ` mature ' ways of having fun and enjoying life like watching an ` art ' movie or going for a cruise .

I personally do not agree with the statement as I feel that it does not take into consideration people 's lifestyles .
Young people can also watch and enjoy art movies if their lifestyle is like that .
Richard Branson the entrepreneur is a major risk-taker and lives life to the fullest .
People have their own ways and methods of keeping themsleves satisfied and enjoy life as the feel is right to them .
There have been plenty of cases where old people have gone water-skiing , I think that they are really enjoying their life !

True there are limitations when it comes to the age-factor , if the biological clock is ticking then one must face it and roll with it .
One can not expect an eighty year old to go rock climbing .
That same elderly person may enjoy him/her self in the compnay of friends or family .

"Enjoying life to the fullest has always been the aim and desire of man .
Everything we do during our lifetime is to quench our thirst for living a better life .
But everyone has a different definition of enjoying life .
Usually the youngsters have a different method of enjoying life than the old people .
But this method is taking its toll on us .
The risk factor associated with the willingness to try everything - which is always associated with the way youngsters enjoy - makes this method one which is not worth giving even one try .

The young people aim to enjoy all the joys which the life has to offer .
But this type of enjoyment is only superficial and short-lived .
After some time , the youngsters get to see the serious and dark side of the life .
Also they realize the futility of what they think to be enjoyable .
But the old people - the more wiser and the more matured , those who have seen what life is all about - have a different and a more fulfilling way of enjoyment .
They prefer to relish their own achievements and accomplishments which have made them what they are today .
They have a more practical and wiser approach towards life and they know the limits of enjoyment .
The young people , on the contrary , do not know their limits and may take their enjoyment to such a height from where return might not be possible .
Or even if the return is possible , it would not be in the manner we would like it to be .

To elaborate this point , consider the example of a group of partying teenagers .
They are still novice when it comes to the skills of living life .
In their desire for enjoyment and willingness to try everything new and `` cool '' , they might use drugs .
The original intention might be innocuous but it may lead to addiction or even death .
Is this what you call enjoyment ?
Mixing drugs with your drink so that you can dance all night long is not called enjoyment , not at all .
It is actually called sheer stupidity .
Taking foolish steps whose consequences we are unaware of can lead to deep regret later .

But what about the old people ?
I think these are the people who enjoy more than the young generation .
How ?
These people have actually gone through all that mentioned above .
They know that one single mistake can actually bring your whole life to a mighty crash .
And there is nothing bad or `` dangerous '' in sitting with old friends and reminiscing about auld lang syne .
It is not the young cannot enjoy , it is just that they do not know `` how '' to enjoy .
Actually , the youth is the time to enjoy and make merry , but today 's generation seems to misinterpret it .
There is a different and a better way of enjoyment than taking drugs and repenting one decision all life long .

"While it is widely assumed that younger people enjoy life more than older people , I do not completly agree with this generic statement .
My stand is based on following premises .

It is true that young people have more energy and enthusiasm to enjoy life .
The most common means of enjoyment for most young people are partying , movies , adventure sports , etc .
However , older people have experienced different aspects of life , and clearly understand what gives them maximum satisfaction and enjoyment .
With limited energy they usually tend to engage in those activities that excite them the most .
The definition of enjoyment changes with experience .
While youngsters may feel that older people can not go out for for sports or parties and therefore are not enjoying , it is possible that older people enjoy the company of their family members than going out for parties .

Also , many a times , what youngsters define as enjoyment is usually what all people do for fun , and not what they themselves would like to do .
Therefore , in effect , they do what society classifies as fun , and not what makes them happy as an individual .
Whereas , there are not many set avenues of enjoyment for old people , and hence they do what they themselves enjoy doing the most .

While people are young , there is lot of uncertainity in their mind about their future .
Some youngsters may have the resources to enjoy but they are constantly busy in working toward their ambitious goals .
On the other hand , older people have their future clear in front of them .
There are not many uncertainities in life , and hence they can spend their free time in enjoying life to the fullest .

Overall , I feel that people who have the maturity to understand what gives them maximum enjoyment , have the required resources for enjoyment and most importantly know how to enjoy , are the ones who enjoy life the most .

"Enjoying life is altogether a different phenomenon taking into consideration the age of the people .
Most people enjoy their lives when they are young and tend to become more sober during their later lives .
There could be many reasons apart from the age factor that makes people to stop enjoying life when they become old .

Firstly , I do think that young people enjoy life more that the older people .
The reason for this might be that the people are quiet young and energetic and hence tend to explore more things in this world .
For example , young people generally like to travel around and see the places they have not visited before .
Not only with the family but also with their friends .
Hence those tours are meant for the enjoyment they can derive being with their friends .
Whereas , older people do not involve in such activities because they may have more responsibilities on their shoulders which the young people may not have .

Secondly , when people become old , they tend to think more about their offsprings rather than themselves .
And also the fact that the people like to look after their grandchildren in their later parts of their lives might deter people from enjoying .
Whereas , young people when they join their colleges , meet with new friends and tend to learn something from their new lives .
This will make them to explore new things and enjoy a little better .

Apart from all these factors , the most important factor is that the old people are being discarded by their children and being kept in the old age homes where they have very little to enjoy .
Youngsters , meanwhile enjoy a lot by partying , dancing and hanging out with their friends .

To summarize , older people like to relax in their later parts of their lives .
They would have also enjoyed when they were young .
Perhaps , this might be the reason , apart from the energy factor that the young people enjoy their lives more than the old people do .

"Life is a jorney !
To measure enjoyment , one really must look deeper into the lives of people and determine what actually enjoyment to people .

I do not believe in the statement , ` Young people enjoy life more than older people ' , as different people have different ways of enjoying life .
Just because one is old and does not have the strength and energy levels as those of young people does not mean that enjoyment in their life is over .
My grandfather was a very happy man untill I knew him .
He had lived life to its fullest and always wore a smile .
He always enjoyed sitting reading a book on that old antique arm chair of his .
I do not believe that is much of a way to enjoy oneself but it was for him .
He may be deprived of hearing but that did not stop him from watching the television .
He simply looked at the moving pictures , drew his own conclusions and had a good time .
He took enormous pride in smoking the best cigars and tobacco pipes available in his era and enjoyed the fact that he could afford to do so .
What is there in it to be so happy about ?
But that made him happy and he appreciated it .

Young people may well be able to do a lot of sporting activities such as rafting , trecking among other thrilling tasks .
They may be able to attend disco-techs all night and play sports they enjoy at higher levels but that does not mean all the happiness and enjoyment in the world .
Old folks may listen to old classics and enjoy themselves more than being at a disco even in their prime age .

They may enjoy the extra relaxation time they get after retirement and do a lot of things they had in mind that could not have been done while they were young .
They may be able to enjoy their family life more than ever before , especially playing with their grandchildren and seeing them grow up .
One does not get to do all this in his younger age .
Imagine all the excitement and memories they are missing out on .
This does not mean that all of a sudden older people enjoy themselves more .

Old people may look bored and weary but they according to me are enjoying life the most .
My grandfather actually told me of all his childhood experiences and was so happy in doing so .
Even the little things mean so much to them and its these litlle things , that we fail to notice , that bring unimaginable joy to them !

"Enjoyment means entertainment , satisfaction of one 's soul and containment with the happenings in life .
I would like to disagree with this statement .
This is because entertainment would mean differently to different people .
Entertainment depends on various factors like the person 's attitude and his notion or perspective on entertainment .

The younger generation tends to enjoy themselves by going to parties , meeting new people , making new friends and going for long drives .
The way a youngster enjoys himself or herself depends on the attitude and nature of the individual .
Some people might like to go to parties for entertainment while others might like to watch a movie .

On the other hand the older people might also do the same things that youngsters do or they may engage in activities considered as dull and boring by the youngsters .
I would like to take examples of two famous personalities here who despite their age never complained of boredom .
Firstly , I would like to take the example of Mother Teresa who despite her old age found enjoyment in playing with children and serving the needy .
Secondly , I would like to take the example of the famous painter , M.F. Hussain .
M.F. Hussain is more than eighty years old but finds enjoyment in his paintings .
He likes to draw and finds his entertainment in his drawings .

We can find people both among younsters and aged who remain depressed and do not tend to enjoy themselves .
They lead the life of a loner and stay in recluse .
The youngsters have a pressure to make their life which may in turn have an effect on the way they tend to enjoy themselves .
But this might not be the case with the older people .
They have a life , they have attained their goals and can live a peaceful life which in itself is an enjoyment .
The old people also tend to enjoy themselves by talking to others of their age and about their life 's experiences .

Thus we see that the entire concept of enjoyment differs from one person to other .
We can never say with surity that youngsters tend to enjoy more than the old people .
Everything depends on the nature and the attitude of people .
If somebody wants to enjoy age is never a deciding factor .
It 's the perspective and the likes and dislikes of a person which tends to decide how well the person is enjoying his life .

"I believe that younger people enjoy life more than the older people do .
Young ones have nothing to worry about and they always remain close to their parents , pals and obviously cartoons which keep them happier .
The older people have much more things to make their life enjoyable but the kind of enjoyment young one takes , its just cant be compared

Firstly , they dont have any sort of tension in their life as the older ones have .
It 's a very wise saying that , `` Life is too short buddy , dont spend the time of your life in worries '' .
Older ones have responsibility towards their family , their job , their society which makes their life somewhat miserable and full of worries as compared to the young ones .
Many philosophers also have supported the view that children are the most innocent species on the earth .
So , obviously being innocent and without worry may be sounds impractical to an older man but in reality this is the main reason behind being happy

The family and friends of a child act as an agent of socialisation teaching them the difference between the good and the bad .
These agents of socialisation always put them in such a domain where the child will always prosper .
They bring every thing for the child that is necessary for his goodwill and for leading toward a bright future .
Friends are also play a big role in developing a childrens life which makes their life enjoyable

Thirdly , they can do the things in their future what the older people do , for instance , going to a club or mountain trekking or having a girlfriend .
But the older people cant have the type of fun the young ones have as they cant switch back to their past .
We heard many times older people saying , `` Wish i would be young again '' and many songs too by famous artists .

Thus , family , friends and all of the agents of socialisation having around the children to keep take care of them , children dont have the thing called worries .
And if they have , then Santacluase always present around them to make them happy

"Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This statement makes us wonder how can one define enjoyment .
Being subjective not only from person to person but also from time to time , enjoyement in totality refers to satisfaction of ones expectations and desires .

In the case of older people , who have `` enjoyed '' the best of their youth , old age brings about a sudden restriction in terms of what they are capable of doing and what they must learn to live without .
No one welcomes this change but some find a way to remain satisfied and happy in there restricted lives .
These older people continue to enjoy life .
But we find that they form a minority .

In the case of young people , faced with limitless possibilities , aspirations and expectations are soaring high .
These youngsters are willing to do whatever it takes to have a good time .
They defy rules , and set new boundaries for themselves to try and cross .
Life for them is like a window .
Their expecations represented by the horizon and their desires by the distance from the window to the horizon .
They can only do so much while their youth lasts .

Comparing the two , we notice that while the youth end up enjoying more than most older people ; in comparison with the limit to which they could have enjoyed , the older people have a higher sense of satisfaction .
They know their boundaries and make the most of their lives eachday .

Almost everyone enjoys their youth , but people who can learn to enjoy their old age aswell are the people who have truely enjoyed `` life '' .
So in conclusion , i would like to say that young people enjoy `` youth '' but older people enjoy `` life '' .

"The question is very tricky as people across all walks of life and across all age groups like to enjoy and it is rather tough to quantify and compare their levels of enjoyment .
Besides there could be people who could derive a tremnendous sense of enjoyment by the most trivial of acts such as the sight of smiling infant .
While there could be some who are never happy with the state of affairs in their lives despite having the best comforts in the world .

In comparing youngsters and adults on the mentioned statement , I personally feel that as youngsters we try to live life to the fullest .
Though we realise the importance of making a career for ourselves we also make it a point to have a ball as and when time permits .
Older people generally tend to be more spiritually inclined and prefer to spend their time doing community work that brings them a sense of satisifaction more than the thrill of enjoyment .
Besides there might also be the feeling that they are beyong the ` age ' to enjoy life in a way as extravagent as we youngters can .

Also the fact that compounds this belief is that as today 's youngsters we have more modes and sources of entertainment and enjoyment at our disposal than did the elders when they were in their prime .
Take for example Computers and Televsion , two of the commonest modes of entertainment today that were not even invented when our grandads and grand nannies were our age .
This sheer availability of resources to us affects our ability to enjoy more .

Then again it is more a matter of personal choice or opinion as every person has his own definition of enjoymnent .
As per the way I percieve it I believe that yongsters today enjoy life on a larger scale that older people do .

"Do younger people enjoy life more than older people ?
This has been much debated and in my opinion , the older people enjoy life much more than younger people .
There are several reasons to support my reasoning .

Firstly , older people have lived most of their years and have been through a lot of stress filled and busy life .
Now its time for them to sit back and relax and pick up other activites for which they probably didnt have time during their younger years .
Whereas , the younger generation is more concerned with accumulating more wealth and improve his career .

Secondly , the youth is busy planning his future and supporting his family .
He has several worries and the current lifestyles do not allow him to enjoy life to the fullest .
He needs to be completely focussed at his career and compete against each other .
Meanwhile , older people generally have achieved most their goals from a career point of view , tend to look at life in a more relaxed manner .

Also , the older man is wiser and knows the importance of enjoying life better that a younger person .
For instance , older people tend to spend their precious time travelling across the globe or spending time with family as compared to younger people who are bound to their work for most part of the year .

While a few might argue that the youthful exuberance would edge out over older people , in my opinion older people enjoy their life more having achieved most of their goals on the professional front and are in a better position to take up new hobbies and new activites .

"Young people tend to enjoy more than the elder people do because they are more energetic than them and are physically stronger .
They got a large list of activities of enjoyment than the list of elder people .

Usually old people enjoy in home relaxing themselves or to the maximum extent of going out for a dinner .
Youngsters have a lot to enjoy themselves in there life .
Since they are physically strong they can indulge into many activities .
I usually enjoy myself by indulging in physical activities like sports example cricket .
I enjoy playing cricket with my friends and I like and enyoy the game immensely .
The game involves lot of concentration and physical challenges with lots of ups and downs which generates great excitement between us during the game .
Older people cannot experience the same feeling as we do .
There are many other activities in which youngsters can enjoy themselves in contrast to the activities of adults .

Another experience which I remember is my school trip to the mountains .
It was a great experience for me and I enjoyed enormous number of activities some of which includes mountain trekking , rock climbing , river rafting and horse riding to be mentioned .
Our teachers also came with us in the school trips .
Observing them one could easily recognise the difference between yhe level of enjoyment between youngsters and adults .
While adults could only enjoy themselves with the scenic beauty of the mountains and the cusine offered at the place or a long walk , we had a wide range of activities to indulge in as mentioned above .
It was impossible for our teachers to involve in the similar activities as we did .

Thus young people enjoy themselves greatly indulging in wide variety of activities and face the world with enthusiasm and excitement with their inexperienced mind without cosidering the thoughts of other people , which the elder people cannot experience .
Hence , the above points support my opinion that young people enjoy life filled with excitement more than the older people .

"The statement that the , `` Young people enjoy life more than the older people do '' , appears very vague to me .
It is a very generalized statement .
In my opinion age is just a number and it is the attidude towards life is that matters the most .
I believe , if we have a positive attitude then no matter what our age is we will be optimistic and have a zest for life and for other social - cultural activities .
In fact as we grow old , we mature and start making wise decisions instead of being impulsive .

Young people in my personal opinion are hyperactive and prudent .
When young we just want to do things which will give us short term happiness or pleasures .
During the growing up years , the tendency is to enjoy and to experience everything without considering the ramifications of their actions .
But when we compare , the enjoyment that comprises of physical activities , like sports or other adventurous outdoor activities ( like biking , hiking , surfing etc . )
then there is no denial that the young people enjoy and make the most of it !

Also when we are young , we face the hardships of life , education , job which at times can leave a little time for adventure or enjoyment .
But as we grow old , by that time , we have taken care of our responsibilities , achieved and accomplished our goals .
Then we adopt a more relaxed attitude to enjoy the benefits of our hardwork .
So in a way it can be a debatable question who enjoys the life more , the young or the old !

As far as I am concerned , I do not agree that only young people enjoy life more .
Enjoyment and happiness are also associated with the way we humans percieve things .
So enjoyment of life by younger generation can also be dubbed as an ambiguous entity .

"By virtue of having ` been there , done that ' , I believe that older people with the gamut of experiences that comprise their lives , enjoy life more so than the young ones who are yet to find their feet .
A younger body also implies a mind that is yet to develop to its full potential .
Despite the physical crutches that age may come with , it remains a magnificent process of learning and developing as an individual .

It is said that with age comes experience .
The experience of years past allows an individual to view situations differently .
The reaction of a 6 year old on getting his first cycle might seem more jubilant than that of his grandfather but the quite pride of watching his grandson gleam with pleasure , speaks of the hard work and commitment that the wrinkled face one sees has learn to put in , to give others such joy .

My friend 's sister , Rita , had had a fight with her friend Ayesha over a trivial matter .
Whlist she did n't want to b the first to aplogise , she still spent the day in a foul mood waiting for Ayesha to initiate the peace making process .
For a young person , a certain situation might seem more complex than it actually is and that was the situation here till Rita 's mother explained to Rita that she needed to judge what held greater importance - her own pride which forbid her from calling , or then her relationship with a friend .
As an older individual , her mother was able to share her own perspective that would enable Rita to make intelligent emotional choices in the future .

As one gets older , it cannot be assumed that one stops enjoying one 's life . '

Young people beleive that only a healthy mind can dwell in healthy body .
Youths have revolutionised the world of entertainment and serves to be the backbone of entertainment industry .

They do every thing , they undertake , with extra vigour and keen intrest .
Undoubtedly their physical state plays a major role in making them appropriate to enjoy life to its fullest .

Playing football is his strength and chess being his meditation .
He also does yogic exercises while in gymnasium .
Moreover indulging himself in sports helps to stay him fit , active and alert .
And this thing had helped him substantially to achieve a sense of contentment at all the three fronts of his life , be it professional , personal or social .

It has been seen that a boy would be very excited and cheerful about his new bike and would take pleasure in admiring the beauty and latest technology , the bike has .

On the contrary our elders are burdened because of their social and professional committments .

"The point of contention is wether young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I do not agree with this statement and believe the contrary .
The general perception might be that young people enjoy and live life to the fullest as compared to older people because they seem the more active of the lot .

I agree that the activities which younger people can indulge in are much more than the activities that older people can indulge in .
However the time required to enjoy these activities would be a factor tilted towards the older generation .
Young people generally lead a very hectic life and may have a very hectic study schedule as the early years of their life are more formative and demand more time towards their academics .
Older people on the other hand have more of leisure time once they retire .
Even people who are working at an older age have much more financial independence as compared to the younger generation .
As a result older people have a higher degree of freedom to indulge in activities they enjoy .
A person matures over the years and an older person can make better choices about activities that excite him .
An older person is thus more likely to derive a higher sense of contentment from the activities he or she indulges in .

A person who is old and , maybe retired is likely to have lots of free time and can learn more about the things he or she enjoys doing .
If for example a person likes to play golf then he has more time on his hands to learn the intricacies of the game .
A young person who enjoys playing golf on the other hand may be hard pressed for time .
Because of this the older person will enjoy the game more for the reason that he has more time to get involved .
As a result it might be the case that young people indulge in more number of activities but do not do justice to each one of them .

Thus in my opinion a person who is older would be leading a more content life and would enjoy his life much more for the reason that he has time to pursue his passions and also the financial independence to do so , both of which might be a hindrance in the case of young people .

he has his goggles on , a bear can in hand , and say , England flag painted on him .
Wo n't you feel a bit annoyed by the scene .
Yes , its true that every diffrernt age group has a particular way of enjoying and even enjoying their joy .
But , it 's quite a bit clear that young people enjoy thier lif to fullest than the aged .
Just looking at the energy of the youngsters , the ways they enjoy and with no pressure of being ashamed , if seen by any one .

The main pointof diffrentiation in youngster and an eldrly person is the energy .
With body getting older , it tend to loose its energy and even the muscles weakens .
When young all the body cellls are young and can store and diliver the maximum energy requied .
So with this we can go on traking , dance , jump , play , and many more things .
But due to lack of energy elderly people cannot enjoy much , especially the things requiring more energy .

Another good reason supporting my point is , number of options available .
You just cannot expect an old man to go for cycling round the beach for 10km daily .
With sour joints , he has to bring lot many limitations to the kind of work he can do .
In contrast , young men and women have many opitions open in the ways they can enjoy .
A person fond of biking can go on long ride every week end , or an athlete can have a mounatin traking program set .
Along with this physically exhaustive joys , a girl willing o dance can take dance lessons and perform whenever she feels down .

Last in the list , and one of important factors of social life is fear of being caught .
With increasing involvement in social life , each has o take care of his image in public .
So the ways to enjoy the life get limited down for a man ho has lived much of his life than a yougster .
If a company boss is seen freaking around on beach is definitely pointed ou , but , if it 's his son is surely admired .

Thus to conclude with , I can only say that though youngsters have more ways to enjoy life than elder people , one can surely define his enjoyment .
Defining it we can be happy with what we have , with no greed for what we do n't .

"A cheetah can run 170 miles/h when its young and slows down when gets older and would rather chase already dieing pray or not even bother for it if he can get his hand on a weaker predator .
As far as this saying goes it is appropriate to state that young people can tend to enjoy a lot more then older people .
life is becoming fast everyday and grows faster by the hour and the faster it gets the more people tend to release out their stress and thus end up enjoying the moments rather then wondering what will happen if they do bad at their job and they turn worse in an interview or even fail at an exam they have preparing for months .
By the time it all happens and everything tends to come through we all realise OH !
my god !
i wasted so much time planning tommorow and look i have become old and useless .
why not leave everything aside and live today .

As the genration has passed peoples thinking has evolved with more night clubs opening and parties held through out the year the new generation has learned to live through the stress rather then live with it .
people who are old and who have not evolved with the times tend to stay in their own little space and move out a little and talk about old times that they had. , missing on the fact the time is now and else is long gone .

MY friend has a grand father whom i respect very much , but then he still lives in the old times and telling us what happened centuries ago and that we should discuss matters that we have no knowledge of what so ever .
while on the other hand if their is an occasion all the benevolent people get together to party while everybody tells us to study .
Its not that we do n't study , we do it when its needed and no compromise with the enjoyments that we have now cuz this will all become a memory in course of time so live it through all , while we all can .

"` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' - I completely disagree with this statement .

I believe that one cannot generalise this concept based on a criteria like age .
One can definitely enjoy life irrespective of age .
It is all a matter of individual preferences , tastes and situations .
I have seen very gloomy young people with absolutely no spirits or enrgy to enjoy life .
At the same time I have met very energetic and joyful old people who ensure that they enjoy each and every moment of their life to the fullest .

One can enjoy life if he has a good company and good circumstances too .
Its not the youth or old age that decides this .
It may appear that young people enjoy more as they hang around with friends in big groups making noises , smoking , drinking and partying all night .
But I believe that the concept of enjoyment is different for different individuals .
For example - I do not need to go to a disotheque to enjoy life but I enjoy life as it is - I enjoy the first rain of the season , I enjoy the fragrance in the air after that first rain , I enjoy my morning cup of coffee with the newspaper , I enjoy sitting at night and chatting with my freinds - and all this I will even enjoy when I am old .

In fact I feel that old people have more to enjoy .
They have ample time especially if they are retired from their jobs .
They have the entire day with them to enjoy .
They do not have to worry about work pressure .
They have beautiful memories and experiences of life that to cherish and feel happy about .
At that age they have an entire life to look back upon and feel relaxed that they have achieved so much .
Whereas young people have so many worries with them always - first school then college then work then marriage then kids and so on and so forth .

In nutshell , it 's not the age that makes one enjoy life - rather it 's the spirit that makes you live life to the fullest enjoying each and every moment of it .

"The statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do is a fairly debatable statement .
My opinion on the same is not in favour of the statement .
I am of the view that one cannot measure how much life can be enjoyed or life is being enjoyed by any one .
Some one appropriately said `` enjoyment is not a commodity , it is the excitement of life we all live for '' .
Enjoyment mean different things to different people , different peaople dirive enjoyment out of different things .
A younger person who is more outgoing enjoys by going partying or meeting people at social events .
A sports fan enjoys by watching his favourite team winning a championship .
A young girl enjoys shopping for hours with her friends , whereas an older person derives pleasure and enjoyment by wathcing his/her grandchildren playing in his/her lap or talking to his children about their successus or achievements .

Different people have different ways to enjoy life and everyone is entitled to this right .
So we cannot justify that older people do n't enjoy as much as younger people do .
Older people have their on ways to enjoy life equaly as much as younger people .
With age only the speed of ones life decreases but the spirit of life remains the same .
With age only the amount of activity decreases not the frequency of joyful moments .
This statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' in my opinion is a superstition .
One which should not be encouraged .

We should not forget that these very old people were once young themselves and enjoyed life the same way as younger people today .
The younger people of today will only realize that older people have different ways of enjoyment when they are in their shoes .

"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe that there is no requirement of an age for people to enjoy their life .
I do not claim that young people do not enjoy their life , instead older people do too .

Those who support this statement would say that when people get old , their enthusiasm dies and due to old age health problems set in .
But I would say that once we are old and free from the daily work schedule we actually get time for ourselves , your families , and our friends .
It gives us the time to pursue our hobbies or passions which we could not attend to when we are busy earning money .
We enjoy our grandchildren more than we might have enjoyed our children .
We have the time to take care of our health , which we probably neglected when we were young and busy with work .
We are more mature and more tolerant due to our experiences , and things do n't affect us as much as they did when we were not so understanding in our youth .
We enjoy our hard earned money after working during all our youth .
We have the time to go for holidays with family and see the world which we did n't see earlier due to lack of time .
In youth due to lack of time we miss out on a lot of things which we can come back to later in our old age .
In our youth , we are immature and things that we enjoy are more materialistic .
Whereas , in our old age , having known the world and become wiser we know that true happiness lies in being a good human and being content with what we have .

Old age brings with it , a lot of good things besides a few bad ones , of course .
But being old does not mean that one cannot enjoy it .
There is rarely a time in your life when you are fully content with the way it is going and when all is actually well .
It is all about the attitude that one should adopt to enjoy life not the age one has .
Old people enjoy life as much , maybe more , than young people .

"Does age really make a difference towards enjoyment ?
Is it only the young who can enjoy and not the old ?
Enjoyment is a feeling which every human being experiences .
Each person whether young or old can enjoy in different ways .
Enjoyment has no bars however the type of activities one maybe involved in to enjoy may differ .

For example , for a young person going to the disco or pubs may be a form of entertainment and enjoyment , however for an older person just reading a book , watching television or going for a long walk may be more satisfying rather than going to the discos .
But not all young people would do this as a form of enjoyment .
Due to ones maturity and age , older people may not like to be around noise or for medical reasons , they may not be able to drink at pubs .

A person who is old is unable to do things that a younger person can .
For example a young person may like to go rope climbing or bungee jumping to enjoy him/herself .
An older person may not be able to engage in such activities as he/she may not be physically strong to be able to do so even if he/she may really want to .

From the above examples , it is visible that there are certain activities that an older person may not be able to indulge in due to their age or physical situations .
Each ones form of enjoyment may differ , not everyone who is young may want to go to a disco or pub .
A younger person may also like to stay at home and read .
Hence its not only the young who can enjoy , its also the old who can enjoy in their own ways .
Hence age should not be a factor towards enjoying life !

"The statements touches upon a very contraversial topic .
It is true that young people spend more time on parties and traveling than the old people .
However , I completely disagrees with the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
I have many reasons for my belief .

It is true that because of age a older person would not be able to enjoy the party life and traveling around the world .
But it is equally true that not only physical activities , but also other activities contribute to the definition of `` enjoying life to its fullest '' .
To give an example , I had a mathematics professor who helped me prepared for compitive exams and standadised tests out side the syllabus .
Although he was retiered , he had a true passion for maths and even at age of eighty he used to solve many challenging puzzles and do recreational mathematical work .
Apart from mathematics , he also had a group of friends , with whom he used to play cards and always participate in various district and national level compititions in chess .
He also kept visiting his two sons once every year and taught his grandsons the secretsof leading a successful life .
From all these and many more activities , he derived the immense pleasure of leading a healthy life .

On the otherhand , consider the yonger generation , where many people commit numerous crimes in the name of having fun in life .
These people suffer severely , when they have to face the punishments offered by the law for their arrogant attitude .
We can find numerous examples of young people commiting inexcusable crimes and facing the punishment for life .
On the contrary , in such cases the young people have to face more sorrows in life than the old people do .

I strongly believe , that to enjoy life , one must have the ability to give joy to other people and share thier sworrows , in whatever small ways possible .
On can achive the ultimate joy of life only if he is successful in creating a harmony in the community around himself .
And I strongly believe there is no age limit to do this , and hence there is no age limit to be happy in life .

"`` You only live once , so live life to the fullest '' is a well known saying , echoed across cultures and countries all over the world .
People are probably tired of hearing it .
It basically means that everyone can enjoy life no matter how old or young they are .
And they should .
Because lost time wo n't be found again .

If someone were to say to me that young people enjoy life more than older people , I 'd have to completely disagree .
There are definitely big advantages being an older person .
For one , you 'd probably have your own money to spend and I 'm pretty sure there 's no better feeling than earning your own bread and butter and then going about spending it .
For example , there 's a strapping young 15 year old lad who likes nothing but to spend his day at the arcade and throw away all his allowance playing a pinball machine .
Allowance .
That 's all .
Now let 's take the example of a millionaire who has n't managed to let go of his childish ways .
He just bought an arcade ( and an amusement park ) and had a few pinball machines moved to his sprawling 12 bedroom , 14 bathroom mansion .
Seems like these oldies have all the fun .
Let 's take into account that in most countries you have be over 21 years of age to go bungee jumping .
Not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n't be able to .

Enter electronic media and technology .
Ever so often we 're subjected to watching millionaires and billionaires on television .
They always seem so happy .
Sure they ca n't really ride a skateboard or a bike but they 've managed to replace that with a more than adequate automatic scooter that they just have to stand on .
I can imagine them zipping around on their little scooter , looking at kids on skateboards and thinking that they 're having way more fun .
In fact to some extent , I even think that older people are `` allowed '' to have more fun .
Yes , it 's unfair .
But such is life .
It goes without saying that with age comes responsibility and I think a complete person is one who accepts his age and his responsibilities towards himself and the society he lives in .
But that does n't mean the fun comes to an end .
It almost never does .
Bad health , beer bellies and balding are a few deterrents from that life of fun , fun , fun .
But then again , you only live once and older people know that better than anyone .
They 're trying to get as much in while they can .

I ca n't wait for my days as an old man kicking back in a comfortable chair and watching soccer on the television .
The fun never stops .

"It seems on the first blush that older people donot have got much work to do , so they might enjoy their lives .
However when one mulIs over the issue with a brainstorming , it is the younger ones who take leisure the most .
Hence I more or less agree with the statement that ` The young people enjoy life more than the older people do ' , by putting following examples .

This is the twenty-first century .
What allures almost each and everyone of us about this is the ` rapid advancement in globalization ' .
The world , day-by-day , is becoming a shorter place to live in .
It does possess all the amenities which are needed for a luxurious life .
Now , who doesnt want to visit incredible continents like - Africa , Antarctica , America , asia etc . ?
Well , I surmise almost everyone of us .
But mostly it is the younger generation who enjoy .

The younger generations do have a spunk and an energy within themselves which have made it possible for the world to shrink in the sphere of tchnological advancements .
With the aid of technology , the youngers exploit good reasons for having fun and enthusiasm .

The wild parties on the exotic beaches of Hawaii , itinerary for majestic and adventuruos wild sanctuaries of Africa and Asia , and many more are done and planned by the current generation .

Older people , on the other hand , live their lives in a solitary by enjoying in their ways , as they become physically shattered due to the old age .
However , the younger generation , often called the ` M tv Generation ' - believes in a sole entertainment along with the advancements .
For example , we often see younger people enjoy the safaries in Serrengitti ( Africa ) , as they have a privilege of exploring more and more as they are young .
Moreover , the amazing stunts of sky-divers and hearthrobbing experiences of the underwater-divers are most prevalent amongst the novices and the young ones .

It is , once in a blue moon , that an older guy attains some accolade and is praised .
To the contrary , the young persons of the society receive kudos often frequently .
This clearly explains that the young people enjoy in a much better way .

However , I believe that the young ones should not be sybarites , that is , there should never be a feeling of hedonism amongst them .
As they have a privilege of enjoyng the grand and august life of this contemporary era , they should exploit it in a healthy manner , rather than milking out the pleasures of the other older people , who ones were young and naive .
It should be the blend of the older people 's experience and the vigor within the youngs which can lead to the prosperity of the world .

"Does young people enjoy life more than the older people do ?
The answer to this question , in my opinion , is `` NO '' .
The following three reasons supports my opinion .
Everyone in this world enjoys life the way he wants to depending on the available resources .
The young people are working full-time and have much more money in hand as compared to that of older people , who are living on old age pensions or working part-time for the little amount of money .
Moreover , as they are old they usually do not have good health and lots of their money is spent in hospital and medicine bills .
Therefore , old people have less enjoyment resources as compared to the young people .
We could find almost all younger people going to resturaunts , clubs and on holidays frequently and think that they are enjoying life .
On the other hand , older people might have also done the same when they were young and might not want to do same at this stage of life .
They might want to travel to a peaceful place like temple or church and spend some time there in peace , which they think they enjoys the most .

The second and most important point is the physical strength .
The older people have very less physical strength as compared to the energetic younger population .
Therefore , the older people want to stay at home and enjoy life with their family , which does not mean that they are not enjoying life but their means of enjoyment is different from that of the younger generation .

The younger generation actuall shows to their peers and others that this is the stage in their life and they should enjoy the most now and tend to show their peers that they are enjoying much more than them and we usually get the perception that young people are enjoying more than the older people .
For example if a twenty year old guy goes to the best and most expensive disco in town , he will be telling this to all of his friends to show his superiorness to his friends .

Therefore the difference is not who enjoys the life more , young or old people , but the difference is how both young and old people enjoy life .
Their preferences and means of enjoyment are different but both enjoy life equally .

With academic pressures, extracurricular activities, and part-time jobs, it can be challenging to find the time to commit to community service regularly. Despite these challenges, many young people still make an effort to give back whenever they can.

Furthermore, social media often highlights negative aspects of youth behavior, overshadowing the positive contributions that many young people make to their communities.

With the rise of social media and technology, young people are often more focused on their own needs and desires rather than on contributing to the welfare of their communities.

With competitive educational environments and job markets, many young people focus on building their resumes and gaining skills that will help them secure lucrative employment.

Furthermore, the rise of technology and social media has led to a more individualistic society where people are more focused on their online presence and personal interests rather than community involvement.

Balancing coursework, internships, and part-time jobs can be challenging, making it harder for young people to commit to regular volunteering opportunities. Nonetheless, many young individuals make the effort to contribute to their communities by participating in weekend clean-up events, fundraising drives, or mentoring programs.

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has made it easier for young people to connect with organizations and causes that they are passionate about. Through these platforms, they can easily find volunteering opportunities, raise awareness about important issues, and mobilize their peers to take action.

Secondly, many schools and universities now encourage students to participate in community service as part of their curriculum.

Lastly, the current generation of young people is more socially conscious and aware of global issues than ever before. They are actively involved in movements for social justice, environmental conservation, and other important causes, showing their dedication to making a positive impact on their communities and the world at large.

"I strongly agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In today's fast-paced world, the younger generation is often preoccupied with their personal lives, social media, and academic or professional pursuits, leaving little time for community involvement.

One of the main reasons for this lack of community engagement among young people is the increasing focus on individualism and self-centeredness in modern society. With the rise of technology and social media, young individuals are more inclined to prioritize their own needs and desires over the collective well-being of their communities.

Moreover, the competitive nature of the academic and professional world leaves little room for young people to dedicate time to community service. The pressure to excel in their studies or careers often takes precedence over volunteering or participating in community projects.

"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are several reasons for this trend. Firstly, the fast-paced nature of modern life, with its emphasis on academic and career success, often leaves little time for community involvement. Young people are under pressure to excel in their studies or advance in their careers, which can make it challenging to find spare time for volunteering or community service. 

Secondly, the rise of technology and social media has led to increased screen time among young people, which can consume a significant portion of their day. Instead of engaging in community activities, many young individuals spend hours on social media platforms or playing video games, further reducing the time available for community service.

Moreover, the breakdown of traditional community structures and the increasing focus on individualism in society have led to a decline in community engagement among young people. With fewer opportunities for face-to-face interactions and a sense of belonging, many young individuals may not see the value in dedicating their time to community service.

Firstly, the rise of technology and social media has led to a shift in priorities among young people. Many spend a significant amount of time on their devices, which can detract from opportunities to engage in community service. The allure of instant gratification and constant connectivity often takes precedence over volunteering or participating in local initiatives.

Secondly, the demands of academic and professional pursuits can leave young individuals with limited time to dedicate to community service. The pressure to excel in school or build a successful career can consume their focus and energy, leaving little room for extracurricular activities that benefit the community.

Furthermore, the lack of awareness or exposure to community issues can also contribute to young people not actively participating in community service. Without a deep understanding of the challenges faced by their communities, individuals may not feel motivated to get involved and make a difference.

One reason why young people may appear to be less involved in community service is the changing nature of how they engage with their communities. With the power of social media and online platforms, young individuals can now raise awareness, fundraise, and advocate for important causes with just a few clicks. This digital activism, although different from traditional forms of community service, can have a significant impact and reach a wider audience.

In today's fast-paced and individualistic society, many young individuals are more focused on personal achievements, social media, and entertainment rather than actively contributing to the betterment of their communities.

One of the main reasons for this lack of community involvement among young people is the increasing emphasis on personal success and self-interest. With societal pressure to excel academically, secure high-paying jobs, and build impressive resumes, many young individuals prioritize their own goals over community service. This self-centered mindset often leads to a lack of time and motivation to engage in activities that benefit the larger community.

Furthermore, the rise of technology and social media has also played a significant role in reducing young people's involvement in community service. Many individuals spend a considerable amount of time on their devices, scrolling through social media platforms or playing online games, which leaves little time for meaningful community engagement.

As a result, young people may prioritize their academic or career goals over volunteering or community involvement. The pressure to excel in various aspects of their lives often leaves little room for community service.

Moreover, with the fast-paced lifestyle that many young people lead today, they may feel overwhelmed and struggle to find the time and energy to commit to community activities. Balancing school, work, social life, and personal responsibilities can leave little time for volunteering or participating in community projects.

In conclusion, while there are certainly young people who are dedicated to giving back to their communities, the overall trend suggests that many do not prioritize community service. Factors such as technology, societal pressures, and busy lifestyles contribute to this lack of engagement in community activities among young people today.",P3,HIN,high,1
"I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In fact, many young individuals are actively involved in various community service initiatives, volunteering programs, and social causes. 

One reason why young people are engaged in community service is the increasing awareness of social issues. With the rise of social media and access to information, young individuals are more exposed to the challenges faced by their communities. This exposure motivates them to take action and contribute in a meaningful way. For example, many young people participate in environmental clean-up drives, organize fundraisers for local charities, or volunteer at homeless shelters.

Furthermore, youth organizations and school programs emphasize the importance of community service. Schools often require students to complete a certain number of community service hours as part of their curriculum. This requirement not only instills a sense of responsibility and empathy in young people but also encourages them to actively participate in community projects.

In conclusion, young people today are actively involved in giving back to their communities. Their participation in various community service activities demonstrates their commitment to making a positive impact on society.",P3,HIN,high,1
"In today's fast-paced world, the issue of young people not dedicating enough time to helping their communities is a topic of debate. I firmly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to community service. There are several reasons and examples to support this view.

Firstly, young people today are more aware of social issues than ever before. With the rise of social media and global connectivity, they are exposed to a wide range of social and environmental challenges. This exposure often motivates them to take action and make a difference in their communities.

Secondly, many young people are actively involved in various volunteer programs and initiatives. Whether it is through school clubs, youth organizations, or community service projects, young individuals are actively engaged in giving back to their communities. For example, many high school students participate in local clean-up drives, food drives, and mentorship programs.

Lastly, the younger generation is more socially conscious and values social responsibility. They understand the importance of giving back and making a positive impact on society. This mindset drives them to actively seek opportunities to contribute to their communities.

In conclusion, young people today are not apathetic towards community service. They are actively involved and committed to making a difference. With their passion, dedication, and drive, they are shaping a better future for their communities.",P3,HIN,high,1
"I agree with the statement that the young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping their communities .

The young generation nowadays in more and more engrossed in their own world of cut-throat-competition than pondering about the problems faced by their communities , let alone work to solve them .
For Example - According to a recent survey the young generation , theGen Y ( those born in the eighties ) spend most of their spare time on the computer playing games than interacting with the people near them , and thus shutting out the avenues for even knowing the problems faced by the community .

The community is itself somewhat responsible for this , by weighing success of an individual in terms of personal wealth , not on the selfless work that a person does for the community .
The emphasis given on the rankings of the `` Richest persons '' of the world , stands testimony to this fact .
Thus the young generation is more and more involved in making money in this rat race and spending lesser time trying to solve the problems faced by the society .

The media might be in part responsible for this , as is evident from the interest in publishing the un-necessary crap like the celebrity gossip , than to highlight the problems of the community , and sensitizing the young generation about it .
The news papers and magazines that we read these days stand testimony to this .

Another fact that contributes to the problem is political turmoil .
Political turmoil causes increasing inflation .
With the inflation on the rise every year , the people have to work more and more for satisfying the same needs as compared to the previous years , and hence are left with lesser free time to deal with the problems faced by the community .

"With progressing generations comes the progression of ideas .
It is commonly said today , that the young generation is very ignorant of what 's happening in its communities .
But i do not believe that this statement is always true .
The mindset of the young generation is highly influenced by its predecessors .
I belive that it is upto the community and the parents ( that is , the older generation ) to instill the values of helpfullness and service in their children .
I would like to illustrate the above , using my own experiences as an example .

I have lived in India all my life and service done by children is not as rooted into the culture as it is in Singapore where i know live .
Since the very beginning , even when i wa sin India , my parents always taught me to helpful not only towards my family and friends but also the environment and the community .
ven when i was in India , i was one of the few kids who went to old age homes to work with the elderly or try my hand at teaching the poor kids how to read .
And these valeus were embibed in me by my parents and hence , my parents were responsible for framing my mindset .

I belive that this culture is more prevelent in Singapore .
Walking across the street , one often comes across a young boy helping an old who 's trying to cross the road .
There are various programs in SIngapore that encourage the youth to help the less privelidged children , help the elderly or the sick in hospitals .
Some time back , i cam across an advertisement that asked for students volunteers to offer some of their time to playing with sick children in the `` National University Hospital '' of Singapore .
The icing on the cake was the long list of names of young people from all over Singaproe who were willing to do this .

Hence , i belive that the above examples , beautifully illustrate that its not always the young people who do not give time to the community .
If the virtues of service and helpfullness are instilled by the community in them , as in the case of Singapore , the young people can be extremely caring and helpful .

"` Community ' is the sole of any civilization .
The stronger the community is the better would be the civilization .
Since community consructs the society and socity has a big impact on the life style of the people living in the society and the literature written , and all these things reflect the progress and prosperity of the nation .
As far as the role of young people in the developmant of the society or community is concern , I am completely agree with the fact that young people are not paying much attentions towards their society now days .
Young people act as the base for any society because thay have the energy and courage .
They are the flag carries of their community .
Any commuinity is reflected by its younger generations .

But now days young people are not understanding their duties towards their community and their nation .
People are geeting more and more self centred and this selfishness is leading them towards this .
People should realize that its only the community that is going to help them .
One cannot live in isolation .
Let us take a example to explain this point .
Suppose if we isolate a person from a community then would the person will servive ?
The answer is definitely negative .
One cannot survive without an environment .
The person is dependent on the community for his basic needs .
All the functions of a community are inter-dependent .
One cannot perform all the fuctions alone .
So here the youths need to understant the fact that they cannot survive without a society .

Secondly , if you are living in an environment then there would be a proper balance between you and the environment .
Your environment must be a developed one in the same way as you are .
To explain this point let us take the example of a tree surrounded by a dirty land then definetly that dirty surroundings are going to hinder the growth of the tree .
So we must learn here the importance of community and its development .

Nowdays youths are not contributing towards the development of their community .
They must reallize the fact that development cannot be made alone .
You wo n't be cosidered as the developed person until unless you belong to a developed nation .

So in conclusion of my view I would like to state that young people , including me as well , should reallize their duties towards their communities and should come forward to uplift it .
I would like to urge them to work for the prosperity and development of their community .

"I agree , to a large extent , that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
But let us have a look at this phrase from a different viewpoint .
Specially , the young people do not have enough time for themselves so the deal comes that where can they find time for helping the communities .
These days young people tend to be busy with their other sources of entertainments , other medias of time spending etc .
But these are just excuses of a sort and the real matter is that may be how busy a person is he/she can always find time to do what his/her preference is .
So basically the young peoples mind have transformed to this extent that their beliefs pertaining to community helping are the lowest priority ones .

For example consider the extent of this phenomena , that if there is a party or a live match of some sport , it is priority ` level one ' .
And the priority level for community help/service basically never comes into picture .
This is what we call as a modern world .
Where people are connected through mobiles , e-mails and chats , but what is the status or problems that the first door neighbour is facing we have no idea .
We would prefer asking about our friend 's health on mails and chats but when it comes to visiting them in reality there arise a lot of other problems , like time constraints and conveyance problems .

So the same is the case with the young people nowadays , they would like to remain in connection with a lot of people and make friends with as many people as possible but only on chats and e-mails .
But this is just the primary effect of the modern world on the youth , there are other serious effects also .
The prime one of them is that the young people have lost the capability to adjust with people of all ages and cultures .
They believe in only one group of friends they are living with and there is no body else they want to care about outside this group .

So reluctancy on part of helping the community comes automatically as a effect of the modern world 's leisures .
But is this effect a mass phenomena .
In one sense yes .
But not in all cases there are people in the young generations also that believe in community and social work culture .
But it can be observed that this kind of people are quite rare and not commonplace .

Though our culture and texts are filled with lectures on group-functioning and team-work and social upliftment but seemingly it is very distressing to see that the kind of tools that the modern world has provided to this generation are making them divulge of their own duties .
But as they say that nothing is permanent and hopefully this culture will also come to an end and the people will start thinking and will soon realise the importance of helping the community since problems do not come to a community it comes to a person and the community shares it .

"Youngsters are the very basis of a society .
It is them who are energetic and capable enough to manage a nation and move it on the lines of development .
It is them , who form the very backbone of a community .

According to me , i dont think that it would be appropriate to blame all the youngsters for not helping their communities .
Well , we have every type of individual in every walk and every sphere of life and it would be inappropriate on our part to blame the complete lot of youngsters for a few irresponsible youth .

The youngsters do actively participate in cultural , social as well as technological events in a community .
For example ; as in my country India , economy boost is going on all because of efforts of the youngsters engaged in private sector management as well as technical tasks which is a help to the nation .

Then , we can also consider that many social activists are youngsters who take initiatives to wipe off the evils from the society .
Social refom projects are mainly running in collages and schools now-a-days .
The youth of today is more aware of the right and wrong and at times , is even ready to teach their elders about it .
Also as we all know that the prominent literary artists , sports personell etc are the youth who , by their good work , bring name and fame to their community and society all across the world .

Although , i wont deny that certain youths do not participate at all in their community development , rather spoil their future by getting engaged in useless types of works or in antinational activities .
Or , such people would get addicted to drugs or so .

In the end , i would like to conclude that youth now-a-days is pretty responsible and aware of its duties as a lot and should not be underrated or underjudged .
I would say they are spending almost whole of their time for their community development .

"I strongly agree that the young people nowdays donot give enough time to their communities .
Young people who are generally considered as the major force , the future of the any nation ironically dont spend much of the time helping the communities .
They generally donot raise voices against the injustic , against the activities carried by the malicious minds present in our society .

Firstly the young people of nowdays are gererally to obessesed by self-needs that they donot tend to think of the society .
The term too-selfcentered is the best to describe the young generation of the era .
The need of money , the self problems like emotional ones tends to isolate the young people form the community as a whole for example the software graduate are willing to work for long hours in order to earn more money .
The greed for money could be for family or for themselves whatever might be the reason he is deprived of his valuable time .
The problem can only be solved by the satisfaction in less money not by abudence of it .
The solution to the emotional problem is that young peolpe should involve in the family more for the emotional support The more spare time they have the more the involvement is there form the part of the youngesters .

The second most important reason is the laws , procedure and policies of the government are as such as the young people tend to think twice before helping and trying to raise the voices in favor of their communities .
For example if their is problem regarding the demolishing of the houses of their communities if the young people want to raise their voices they might end up in the jail .
This is the result of the flaws of the laws and policies of the government .
The solution to the problem is the laws and policies should be such that young people are not scared against helping their community .

The less greed for money accompanied with the work-satisfaction & the laws and policies which are not harsh will generally encourage the young peole nowdays to help the communities .

"I partially agree with statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
They are more after creating a comfortable niche for themselves even if it may demand seclusion from the community they came from .
But the scenario is slowly changing .

The first thing which may be useful to analyse is the focus of the young people today .
Where are they looking themselves after 10 years of their study ?
Will their work help the community they come from ?
Today 's generation is more interested in high profile jobs which will help them earn more .
These are areas like software programming , telecommunications , research labs etc .
Very few people are today interested in taking up positions in the Non Govermental associations which work for the community on a no profit basis .
Also , it has been noticed few people actually want to become professors at universities and this has even led to the shortage of faculty at certain educational institutes .
Thus there is a slow drift from the jobs which actually work for the community .
Some people may argue that an Indian researcher at Microsoft Research is contributing to the community besides a comfortable life also .
But the bigger question is if the new technology built by him be available to the Indian below poverty line and that too at a easible cost .
Clearly no .
Thus , if young need to contribute to their community through their work , the work must be focussed and not just a pretence for such an argument .

Most of the young after completing their graduate education take up the lucrative job offers abroad .
These includes high profile banking jobs , research lab positions , or even the jobs that are similar to that in their own country but are `` abroad '' .
These people , the Non Resident citizens ( NRC ) then give grants to the government and feel satisfied that they have done their bit towards the community .
But actually a large fraction of this money goes directly into the pockets of a few corrupt politicians .
The money could have been well utilized if the NRC could have come down to his own country , spent some time there and looked after the utilization of his grant .
But that is the foremeost question .
The generation today does not have `` time '' .
The mindset of the young clearly needs to be changed .

On the other hand , many institutes around the world today have realized this need of students having to contribute to the society that actually built them .
For example , the Indian Institutes of Technology have started a scheme where it is the part of curriculum of the student to actually spend some time doing some service to the society .
This includes going in the schools and taking classes , working for better living conditions by taking up sanity projects in the nearby underdeveloped colonies .
Though the students were intially skeptical towards scheme called the National Service Scheme , but now they have realized the importance of this work and are coming forward to take up various projects .
Such schemes if implemented , can bring about the changes in the attitude of the young .

Focussed more on career , the young generation today is losing its focus from contributing to the society they have actually come from .
They tend to delve into the comforts of their own lives that helping the community around them .
This has to change if society needs to progress .
However , many attempts in various parts of the world have initiated this process of changing the mindset of the young and have been successful .
The young have now started to realize their responsibilities and to share with the community what it has given to them .

"I believe with the statement that `` Young peoples nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
Primary reasons for such attitude would be drastic change in their lifestyle , constant peer pressure , too much focus on shaping their own carrers and change in social values .
I would take some of these issues to prove my stand .

Young people are now under the effects of corporate culture everywhere .
Whether this be their schoo , home or office .
This demands them to be at their best everytime .
They are expected to be first in their classes , decide startegies of business management , earn money .
All these leads them to focus more on shaping their own identity and rather contributing towards their community .
Young people put in much more efforts in terms of physical work then being put up by people of same age generations ago .
This leaves them absolutely with no time for contributing towards their community .

With such mad rush behind money , young people have become highly self-centric .
They are not worried about suffering of their community , let alone doing something to remedify it .
Young people with their living habits , social settings and behavior patterns likes to remain detached from everyone else .
Leaving community , young people find it difficult to communicate with their parents and family members .
This is not just because of communication gap but as well they are not concerned about their state .
In most of the cases they are non existent for them .
With such apathetic attitude towards their parents , spending time for their community can be easily ruled out .

Idea to help and connect is dying .
A perfect example of this could be of how we like to make new friend through internet but young people are hardly aware of sufferings of r next door neighbour .
Perhaps an example of apathy of young people towards their community can be best seen with recent Katrina hurricance in America .

"I agree to the statment that young people are not giving enough time to help their communities and I have my reasons for such belief .

In the following paragraph , I shall bring forth my rationality for taking the particular stance .

First we need to analyze what has changed over the time .
Is the communities expecting more out of young people or is young people are facing crunch of time to devote to their community .

I feel that the expectations of communities has not increased over the period of time but it is due to the change in mindset of young people .

Due to advent of new sources of entertainment , people have less time to spend for other activities .
Earlier , the general idea of an entertainment was to meet people , go out play with children in park etc .
This way people interact with each other and can understand problems if any faced by community member .
Now entertainment is taken over by play stations and other electronic items which keep people occupied during their leisure time .
The defination of entertainment has changed over the period .
It is more of an indoor event than of an outdoor event , which has made life more dull and led to less interaction with other people .

These days , life is more fast paced and which has changed the attitude of young generation .
They want to achieve as much as possible in short span of time using the shortest route .
Due to this rush , people are becomming more materialisitic and they started less giving less importance to old values .
This is another grave reason which has significantly curtailed the participation of young people in community .

Nuclear family is another thing which have contributed to change in the people 's attitude .
Earlier people use to stay together as a joint family .
This way grand parents were able to inculcate the good moral values in young ones and they were able to use them as a pillar in their life .
Now families are growing smaller and parents have less time to spend with their children .
Due to which they are not able to impart those moral values into their children .

In the end , I would like to summarize that people 's mind set has changed over the period and if the trend continues then we will see less and less participation of young people in community exercises .

"I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think this is a misconception arising due to the outdated views on how a community is defined and also the ways to help the community .

The complaint seems to be that the youth are so self-indulgent and selfish in pursuing their own career goals and ambitions that they do not devote enough time to community .
But we must recognize that the individual is the basic unit of society .
So if the individual does something to improve his or her quality of life , the overall average quality of life of the community increarses .
In turn such people also inspire other people to better their lives and start a progressive trend .
It is a situation similar to say a scientist isolating himself from society to excel in his inventions , but then the fruits of innovation are shared by all .

A more serious aspect of this complaint can be the supposed indifference of the youth towards their community .
This complaint also has roots in how do we define the community traditionally .
In today 's ever shrinking world where more and more people of different communities come together and work , the youth seem to be embracing a larger community , and their commitments to this emerging but broader community might seem to affect their contribution towards their local community .
Again , I would argue that if the youth are working towards some greater common good then that is bound to benefit all in the long run .

Another point I would like to make is that if the young people devote relatively more time towards their self development , they will be more stable and more capable of helping back the community .
Basically they would be able to help the community ina better way and even in more impactful way .
For example , many institutions benefit from the funds and projects that their alumni bring back to their alma-mater .

The real problem can be when the young people are not doing something constructive and productive .
We definitely need to guard against such apathy towards oneself and hence the society .
But this malady does not restrict itself to young people only and hence it would be wrong to blame only the young for such behavior .
In fact , I think that young people are more enthusiastic and less cynical than most of the older generation .

In summary , I would assert that an individual is the basic unit of society .
As long the individual is involved in something that is constructive or beneficial to at least the person himself , the overall community is bound to get the benefits sooner or later , not neccesarily in explicit terms but in more subtle and impactful ways .

"The young people of today are a much more informed and aware group of people than young people in the past ever were .
They are the future of society and community and ofcourse have a big role to play in giving back to and helping their communities .
It is unfair to say that they do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I am of the opinion that young people nowadays give as much if not more time than the youth of years gone by ever did to helping their communities .
The youth of today having had more oppurtunities than youth of yester years ever did have benefited greatly from the same .

There are several examples from recent years that go on to prove how young people have devoted a lot of their time and energy towards forwarding a cause that is related to their communities .
As a particular example , one may look at the anti firecracker drives undertaken by young people across several regions during festive seasons .
Such campaigns are aimed at issues ranging from reducing the pollution levels experienced due to bursting of firecrackers to more grave topics such as tackling child labour ( often being emplyed in fire cracker factories ) .
However , some may argue that as a movement such anti-firecracker drives may be instigated not by young people themeselves ; but the fact remains that such drives are successfull only due to the active participation and support of young people .
And we have sufficient evidence to belive that these movements are more successful today than they ever were in the past .

Another example is that of community service programs initiated in several private schools over the past few years .
It is now compulsory in several schools to complete a certain number of community service hours .
What is most heartening is that I myself have experienced first hand how many students are interested in devoting more time than is compulsarily required of them .
A myriad of social service clubs have formed in schools .
In my own school , such a club was in the nascent stages when I graduated .
Once again , cynics may argue it is not the youth themselves who are jumping in on community service ; but the bottomline is that the average school going student today probably spends a lot more time in community service than a student did ten or twenty years ago .

One arguement that must be put forth to make the case for the young people today even stronger is the current state of growth and development of communities in different regions .
Barring a few exceptions , the standard of living of people has gone up over time and therefore so has the standard of the community that houses these people .
In my opinion , it is not possible to explain such an improvement in community life without giving some credit to the young people of the community .
Even if the younger people may not be at the helm of organising community get-togethers and events , they are most often the ones that participate heartily in the same .
Such active participation definately goes to help their communities develop .

"`` The younger generation just dont listen and pay gratitude towards community '' .
This is the statement I very often listen from my grandfather .
Have the younger generation actually become so selfish and preoccupied in their own world that they do n't even have time for their own people ?
Being a young man myself , I feel that it is shameful , but true .

With the advent of technology , the world has become fast paced .
Everybody is short of time is always busy with worldly matters .
The greatest impact of this is seen in the younger generation .
Younger generation are called the future of a nation .
They constitute that section of the society which is very vibrant and full of energy .
At the same time they are also immature and tend to get influenced by external forces , the most .
So , they tend to get distracted to a number of activities around them .
So getting attracted to Rock music , going to concerts is natural .

But let me pose a question to all the youngsters - Have you ever gone to do community services - like helping old people , helping out orphans , or planting trees ?
I bet the answer to my question would be a unanimous `` No '' .

Futhermore , youngsters nowadays are excessively involved in partying with friends or playing online computer games that these type of community activities have the least priority on their list .
Infact , these are sometimes considered to be boring and the `` Older people 's job '' .

The young people need to realise this fact that it is due to a mutual interaction between an individual and his community that an individual develops .
So , the individual requires to take care of his community .

But , Is it that it is solely the younger generation responsible for this apathy .
I think there is some other aspect to this discussion as well .
This is based on what I have seen in my college .
There is a small percentage of youngsters who are interested in doing good for the community , but due to the excessive pressure of the parents to excel in the exams , loads of courses that we are required to complete and excessive competition , these students are unable to do anything concrete .
Who is responsible for this the youngsters or the elders ?
It is pretty clear , the authorities have to think on these lines if serving the community is a matter of concern .
For example , the college authorities can float a compulsory course in Community Service .
So , in a way this course will motivate other student as well as let the already interested students to participate .

In conclusion , the younger generation need to realize that it is their responsibility to help the community because it is only bcause of this community that they would flourish in the future .
They need to understand that if they help the community the community would surely pay them back in a good way .

A considerable amount of time has to be invested in it to provide fruitfull results .
Young people have to nurture the community and make it a better place for children and future members .

Especially for young people who have their entire life in front of them & its time now for them to decide in what direction they will steer their attention to get to the destination which will take life to the aim that they have to achieve .

For a start they have to attend college .
Some times have to pay for it themselves .
So for that work part-time .
But now-a-days i can see students dont mind working for their own education .
They have become more active in the society .
They have started realising the important of human values like honesty , humanity & trust .
Hence , I disagree with statement that is made here that young people donnot give enough time or help their communities .

I can give you an example which i experienced myself .
Few months back , in my city there was an excessive rainfall in a season when it was completely unexpected .
Hence , the government resources were not available on time .
At that time , people staying near the place , where lots of water was creating a blockage of traffic , came onto the streets to help the people for crossing the roads which were under water .
I even heard news that these people provided shelter & food to those who couldnt get to their homes due to lack of trasport .
All these people helping out others were young .
It was quite evident because old ones couldnt help doing so many things by walking in rains .

There might be some youngsters who are involved in drug activities or crimes or some even `` doing nothing sitting at home '' types .
But you cannot judge the entire young generation only by looking at them .
I think that today 's young generation is very much awake about its responsibilities & are doing their duties well , without fail .
Giving them opportunities to do it is now the responsibility of our community .

"There has been a lot of change in the behaviour and attitude of the youth towards their communities nowadays as compared to earlier times .
Today , young people are more concerned about their own personal development rather than the developement of the communtiy they live in .

Because of more professional competition between people and a desire to move up the success ladder , people have forgotton their social responsibilties .
They have forgotton what their community has given to them and what their duties are .
Young people leave no stone unturned to be successful and work with all energy and detremination for their own growth .
But they often have lack of time for helping their communities , most of the youth are not concerned and sometimes are not even aware of who their neighbours are and about the societies they live in .

In earlier days , youth worked hard for community upliftment .
For example , Swami Vivekananda , apart from his personal growth , also worked for improving the status of women in the society .
His followers preached his ideas and principles and this led to the betterment of the society .

Such examples are rare to be seen now .
Advances in science and technology have helped the society but have also brought many mishaps .
People are thought of as machines , who work day and night without worrying about their parents who would be waiting for them at home .
Youth have forgotton towards their responsibility towards their own parents .

Youth have taken to several different forms of entertainment as a source of passing their time .
In their free time , they would surf the net or hang out with friends .
To give an example , many of my college mates pay no attention to the news or any natural calamities .
They are only concerned about them and their relatives .

This trend can be easily seen in case of a calamity like droughts , floods where people above the age of 40 are actively involved in the helping the affected people .
Youths are preoccupied with other non significant issues like a party at their friends place or a routine get together .

Hence , with the help of the above mentioned points I conclude that youth nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .

"I think the statement that ` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ' is too general .
It always depends on the type of person whether he wants or does not want to serve his community .
There have always existed people who owing to there ambitions or vested interest do not give time to helping their communities .
So saying that this is the case at present only , would be very unfair .
There are numerous examples of young people world over who made it their lifes target to serve their community .

But I would agree to the point that there has been a considerable decrease in the number of young people serving their communities .
This is mainly do the following reasons .
Due to the process of rapid globalization the belief of ones community is decreasing as people now consider themselves more a part of the worlds cosmopolitan community rather than to aparticular community .
Also due to the ever increasing competetion in evey field the young people do not find much time to serve their community .
The high amount of stresses the youth are undergoing due to the ever increasing work pressure make them believe in enjoying whatever free time they get .
So they are more inclined to merryment and parties in their free time rather than to serve their community .
Earlier the reason for more contribution by the youth towards their community and country was that most of the countries were under alien rule and were fighiting for their freedom .
So this generated more patriotic tendencies among the young people .
Today this factor is absent at most of the places .

I feel that todays youth are more inclined to first make their lives successful and then at a later stage in life when they have achieved their targets they contribute to their community .
For example Bill Gates , in his youth might not have found much time to serve his community to agreat extent , but now that he has achieved his targets he is contributing a lot to the people of America .

In my country India , there is a group called RSS which is mainly composed of young people with senior leaders to guide them .
The main objective of the group is community service i.e. serving people in cases of drought , flood , natural calamities or any problem for that matter .
Also in college we have students teaching underpriveleged people free of costs in the evening hour .
So we find that though there has been a decline in the number of people serving there communities but still there is lot of work being done by the young people .
Here I would also like to point out that though some young people might not be serving their community in particular but by working in the field of scientific advancement in nation which offer better opportunities they are serving the humanity as a whole and so they are also serving their communities .

Thus I partially agree with the statement that thought there has been a decrease in the number of youth serving their communities but still there are youth making efforts in this direction .
Also they might not be contributing much in their youth but in a later stage of life when they have achieved their goals they contribute in a big manner .

"Youth is the power of a nation .
A nation 's progress rely majorly on the performance and contribution of its youth .
A youth , today , has multiple task to handle .
I believe , most of the young people are under the pressure of perfoming the best .
This pressure drives them away from their responsibilties .
They are more focussed on self advancement .
This focus takes them very far from their source .
Therefore , young people do not give enough time to help their communities .

I am a student and currently pursuing my engineering degree in biotechnology .
This course demands greater devotion and dedication towards the studies .
I have to attend college , do projects after college and also participate in various events taking place in my college .
All these responsibilties does not give me enough time as free .
Thus , I fail to give a helping hand to my community .

Youth is the time of life where one is brimming with energy and enthusiasm of moving ahead in life .
If this energy will not be manifested to work towards one 's goal then , one 's dream would never be fulfilled .
Helping and serving the community could happen at any time of life .
But this golden period of youth will never come back again .

A nation 's progress will uplift if it has youth who are contributing their best in every field .
Take the example of Sania Mirza who entered the field of lawn tennis in her teen-age .
Her devotion and dedication towards her game made her popular in the entire world of lawn tennis .
This also lead to the popularity of our country .
In other words , she was like an ambassador of India .

Sachin Tendulkar entered cricket when he was nearly 18 years old .
He made himself and his country proud by his hard work and dedication .
So , we see that in order to go ahead in life one has to harness energy in one 's field of interest .
This would eventually require one to give the maximum time to one 's work .
But this does not mean that one should not give time to help communities .
This can be done when one is settled in life .
Then the contribution would be much more and it would be more meaningful.i.e. one can help his community financially , in person or in any other way which is possible .

"The idea of young people not devoting enough time for the services of the community is really controversial .
Some people say that young people prefer more of their time towards achieving thier goals in life , while other say that they are really worried about the community and thus they help it by one way or another .
I believe , however that materialism existing in the world is withdrawing the young people away from the social services .
I offer following points to support my opinion .

Firstly , in this modern era of rapid technological progress their are everyday there is new electronic gadget introduced in the market which provides an effective means of entertainment to the people thus , decreasing the need of community in their lives anymore .

Secondly , the young people are tired of all the bloodshed or trickery going on in the camouflage community which lead to communal riots or the biased decisions taken by the communities .
Like , deciding a wealthy or influential person as a head of the community who does n't deserves it .

In addition to this , the cut-throat competion prevailing in this era forces the young lot of the community to work more and more to achieve success and thus most of them end up with the shortage of time for their community and family .

Furthermore , the corruption prevaling at different levels in the community is also reponsible for discouraging more energetic and tenacious young people to be a part of it .
An individual always tend to consider his / her family interests over the interests of the community of which he/she is a part .

Moreover , now-a-days the rigor of their hectic lives and the above mentioned alternatives do n't let the youger generation realize the importance of camaraderie and commuinty .
Certainly , herculian afforts are required to inspire the youger generation for involving in communal decisions .

To conclude in a nutshell , in present world young people are more focused in the happiness in their personnal lives rather than offering their sevices for the betterment of the community .

"Communities have been there for the people themselves in making their lives easier .
During ancient times communities meant a lot to those ( people ) who belong to them .
Does the communities still have the same significanace in one 's life , now ?
Absolutely no , thats what that could be seen .
So obviously people are not giving enough time for them .

With the advent of industrialization people are getting more and more mechanical and self - involved than ever before .
Since nowadays they there are things which does n't need involvement .
For example if want to buy fruits , all you need to to is to go to supermarket and pay there and return back , but it was different earlier when people were using barter system there it required more interaction among people and consequently more interaction with the communities .

With the mechanical life people have comparatively very less time even for themselves and for their families so it is not surprising if they do not have a lot of time for their communities .

Industrialisation not only brought machanical life but also devaluation of the emotions .
People not only devalue the morals but also the significance of community ,

People now have more greed for money and less heed for the values .
All what people can do for their communities is donating money but it is not always the best way .
For example , in most of reputed colleges rich alumunis feel a sense of doing for the betterment of their communities by donating huge amount of money but sometimes it 's not the money but rather the need of their expertise , their experience etc , but unfortunately this all requires time which might not be available to them .

So , we can see that community 's significance has decreased , it could be accounted to the industrialization which made people 's life more individualized , paying more attention towards money than the rest with no time for community .
Therefore , one can be agreed with the statement that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ''

"YES i agree that young people do not get time helping their communities .
the reason for this i think is the increasing of the fast and busy life and also because of more and more increasing compettition .
this leads to the pressure on the young people and require to struggle as much as they can to lead a succesful life .

earlier the fight for the facilities , employment , leisures of life were not so difficult to achieve .
this may be because the earlier life was more simple .
but as there is a boom of technologies and introduction to new fields , the young people require much harder effort and persisstance to get through the comming challenges .
earlier the structure of the societies was also different than it is today .
their was much more interaction between people and the young ones and the adults would participate together .

Another reason of the availability of less time for the young people can be because of the introductions to more and new means of entertainment , interaction etc.entertainment like television etc. and interaction facilities such as internet chats or mobile services etc.therefore the young people spend most of the time in either struggling for their better lives or spending time with new means and sources for leisure whenever they get free time .
for example a person with the same 24 hours if given a choice would do more productive work which would be beneficial for him in future than spending time to interact with people .
the phrase ' survival of the fittest ' is now best suitable for the developing societies and young people wants to cope up with the speed to find their way for their easy survival .
even in case of small children , the increase in the difficulty of their subjects and the increasing load has restricted them to spend more time in playing with their friends .

i would say that the young one are not to be blamed of the current senario because the situation has created a need for them to behave in a more introvert rather than more extrovert manner .
the young people , s behaviour is changing due to change in the structuring of the overall society .
the society is forcing the young ones to fight more for their future than living the present and spending time to socialise and time witheir communities .

The above reasons i think justifies that why young people do not give enough time to help their communities .

"I would most certainly disagree with the statement that , young people of today do not give enough time to helping their communities .
At first sight , it might appear so because of their comaprison with youth of previous generations .
But the new problems have arisen and if examples of these are considered , the vision of the youth to helping and building their communities is clear and direct .

The youth of today are marching forward in the realms of technical development and innovation but at the same time , not shying away from their responsibilities towards their community .
Working in the role of a software engineer in the growing IT industry , along with my team at work , I have organised and participated in blood camp drives .
We have also participated in sessions to spread awareness for the need of preservation of wildlife .
We actively focus on issues at the local community level and try to bring them to the notice of the municipal administration .

The youth has also been actively involved in issues of preservation of cultures .
Oragnisation of festivals and celebrating them with full enthusiasm is easily visible with the media attention it attracts along with the steadily increasing participation .
Tradition is what binds a community together and the youth has held onto this thread of distinctiveness .

The world today today has moved from a set of local communities to a global village .
The biggest threat to the entire world arises from the spread of HIV/AIDS .
This generation has been completely receptive and also taken responsibility to eradicate this threat from the face of the earth .
By spreading education about the reasons of its uncontrolled growth , the youth has shared responsibility with governments from world over , who have provided funds for the same .
By fighting this as a world community , we will be able to eliminate this disease .

The commitment and time by young people nowadays towards helping their communities has not dipped .
The youth understands the responsibility laid down on its shoulders and promises not to disappoint anyone .

"Specifically the topic refers to a very pressing problem in todays time .
As a young individual I regretfully agree to the topic that the individuals of today do not give enough time to helping their communities .

One of the reason attributed to this is that the young generation does not have enough time to deal with the problems of the society .
We are so much engrossed in our daily activities that far from giving attention to our society , we are not devoting time to our children and our aged parents .
The society has become excessively money minded , married couples are working 10-12 hours in their jobs that leaves practically no time for other matters .
I do agree that doing your job is a must but probably we have to find a way to give time to our family , society .

Helping the comminity does not only means that we donate money to it .
It probably demands much greater attention on our part .
We are learned men and women , probably the best brains ever produced , thus it is our responsibility to attack the problems together and work out a rational solution which reflects our intellect .
But the problem is again our self - centered nature .
Today people are just concerned obout themselves , their business , how much profit they made and ways to enhance their economic conditions .
The society has lost its significance as most of us today prefer to live in secluded appartments , aloof from others .
Most of the inhabitants in a building sometimes dont even know the person living next door .

Because of too much of interest in profit making nowadays , corruption has crept into our society .
The business organizations sometimes resort to unethical practices which may also endanger the health of the public which uses their products .

A recent example has been the case of softdrinks .
In order to earn more profit , the company didnt took any measures even when it was revealed that it contains large amounts of pesticides , a great danger to human health .

We have forgotten the ideals which the leaders of our country Mahatama Gandhi , etc gave us .
Today we are more inclined to fight with others , even get them killed if they do not resort to our demands .
Typical examples can be seen in the young generation in india which do not even respect their parents , leave them after all the hard work parents put to nurture them .

The generation gap is widening in our society because of which we tend to oppose uur parents and in many cases even prefer to live alone rather than living with them and serving them .

Thus in short it can be said that even though our society is advancing by leaps and bounds the moral values are degrading and we forget our community which gave us the resources and means to flourish .

"As the countries of the world progress into the 21st century , the ever-increasing complexities have yet again slapped the question of time-management on the face youngsters today .
However , I feel the young people of this century have responded splendidly by ensuring enough time for all activities .

The youngster 's of today are vibrant , dynamic , filled with an ever-increasing enthusiam to perform , achieve , aim high but in all this they still maintain their standards and attitude towards life .
Various qutodian examples of this can be citied from our society .
Renowed writer and Booker prize winner Arundithi Roy is a classical example of this .
She has not only helped in the cause of the ` Narmada Bacho Abhiyan ' ( for saving the river of Narmada in India from pollution etc . )
by preventing the formation of a dam that would have hampered the flora and the fauna of the region tremendously but has also added fuel to the fire by gainings wide-spread public sympathy and amenable opinion on this .

The founder of ` Microsoft ' ( the No1 software firm in the world ) , Bill Gates has contributed tremendously towards various social causes like building up Cancer hospitals , adopting entrie villages after the Tsunami earthquake and promoting education at all levels .
This would have definately required him to take out immense amount of time from his work and he stands as a perfect example with whom the youngsters of today relate .

A very qutodian example can be cited as that of my own society 's ` Help the Needy ' organisation of which I am an active member .
This voluntary organisation aims at heping not only those ( humans and animals ) who are needy but also aims at spreading similar feelings and enculcating in the youngster 's of today the very essence of helping their community .

At ground levels , it can be seen that the youngster of today are striving to help their communities and society as a whole by ensuring reforms are enacted and implemented correctly .
The youngsters today are intelligent and discerning and they know that by helping their communities and societies they are actually helping in making their own future better .

"I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Being young myself , i can mirror my experiences and provide reasons why young people are not giving enough time to help their communities .

First of all , its a competitive world these days .
The day the child is born , the parents of the child start preparing a road map for their child and before the child can understand anything about life he is on his way to reach that perfect goal .
In the run for that ultimate achievement , he gets so occupied in his own struggle that he forgets that there 's a community also which needs his service .
As he struggles harder he gets more and more self centered .
In the fast pace of todays world , when everything is getting nucleated , people are loosing touch with each other and that is one big reason the young people are finding less and less time to help their communities .

Another similar reason is that as the world is becoming smaller and globalised , people are moving from their native places to newer destinations for jobs or personal reasons .
This shift makes them loose touch with their communities as they struggle to get absorbed in the new place .
With successive generations , they get farther and farther from their native culture and community and at the same time they do not feel one with the new community they become a part of and because of this reason they are not able to contribute fully to the new community also .

Furthermore , there has been a degradation in morals these days .
The spirit of community over oneself has given way to more selfish aspirations .
One factor that I would ascribe to this degradation is lack of interest on the part of parents to teach their children properly and give them lessons in community work .
As the parents themselves are occupied in their life they forget to teach their children a lesson or two about community service .

Finally , there has been a growing tendency among youngsters to look at the government for welfare work .
They feel it is the government 's duty to help in the development of communities .
They do not actively participate because of their expectations from the government .
What is required rather is a more active role from young people in helping their communities and realising their duty towards the community .

Something or the other just keeps happening in this nation of millions .

What has given birth to this never say die attitude ?
the normal conclusion will be that its the new generation that holds in its hands the reigns of a powerful and majectic nation .
The pertinent answer to that will be yes the youngsters are responsible for its community .
I totally disagree to the statement ` that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ' .

I am of the same genre that we talk about here .
I would ask how have I not served my community ?
I have taught in blind school that exists just beyond my college , who had forced me to do it ? , nobody .
The reason why I did it is the fact that I think I am responsible to keep everybody priveledged or underpriveledged at the same level .
Infact I felt that this is the least I could do to help those who are less fortunate than me .

As a rule I do n't believe in giving alms , I feel strongly against the notion that any able bodied person should beg and not work .
That is what I do , I work , I contribute to the economy , I work , I pay my taxes on time , I have the will to see that my abilities are used to the fullest so that I grow , in turn my agency grows and that will in turn make my economy grow .

If somebody feels that I stiil have not contributed enough to my community then I must add that my community holds adults and children .
I love and respect both .
Not only do I spend time with them , I stimulate others to spend time with them too .

As an onset I would finish with the statement that I do contribute to my community and I am still counted amongst ` young people ' .
I will continue doing this because I do n't have a point to prove but the fact that my conscience asks this out me and this is the minimum I can do to make people who matter to me more special .

"The young people of today are very commonly reffered to as the leaders and the great minds of tomorrow , yet we find ourselves asking wether the youth helps its community .
My responce to this would be that the young people are just as concious as the elders and they fell just as responsible for the welfare of the community .

To ensure that the young adults feel responsible towards their communities , they are inculcated with these values as children by making the children feel more responsible towards their srounding world .
This is done by incorporating a community service section into their school curriculims and allowing the children to discover the satisfaction of sharing .
These young influences are carried along with the youth and as they grow , so does their sense of responsibility to society .
Then these young people do infact spend time from their busy schedules to serve the community .

Nowadays we continually see student-run organizations and events that are held for the benifit of the community and also function as awareness programs to show the adults of the community what the problems within their own sorroundings are .
The profits from these types of funds are then put into good use to benifit society .

One such example in my life that we , as the students of my school achieved for the international organization , The Red Cross was that we had a fund raising event that was in the form of a party to the young childre .
We had ortganzed games and other such events that fascinated the kids and earned us enough money to make a considerable donation to the foundation for earthquake relief in Gujrat , India .

I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Young people of today are just as concerned for the preccious comunity that we live in as are the adults .
After all , what is the point of being a leader tommorrow if we can not preserve our community and hertage today ?

"Now a days young people are more occupied with their needs and wants .
They usually get less time to serve for their community .

Individualism is spreading across the globe and youngsters are getting most affected by it .
They are becoming more selfish and care about only few people around them .
This makes them indifferent to the problems of the community .
The needs and wants of the young people are increasing at a very high rate .
Thus , they spend less time doing community work .
The high level expectations of youngsters out of themselves make them study and work harder .
This leaves them with less time to help others .

Though the young people are getting more conscious about their enviornment and people around them , they consider the problems associated with the community and the enviornment less important than their own problems .
They consider personal enjoyment more important than societal development .
This can be seen by example of lesser number of younsters who go for social service than number of youngsters who party quite often or study more .

In some segment of society , young people now are more distracted by the modernization of the society .
They prefer to go to a party or hang out with friends as compared to help their parents in their work .
In other segment of the society , the decrease in concern for the community is also due to increased pressure from their parents .
Now parents are more concerned about future of their children and thus nurture them to study and work for more hours .
This results in less interaction of the children with the society and hence , less concern for the community .
The pressure from the society and parents make them introvert and selfish .

But sometimes the youngsters do help their communities by inventing new things and implementing new ideas .
For example , some young scientist may invent a machine which can efficiently remove hazardous materials from water in lesser cost .
This invention does help society .

Youngsters now a days do not help their communities much .
Instead they prefer either to party or study .
They have developed selfish attitude .

"HELP OTHERS TO HELP YOUR NATION

In the present day world where technology is advancing at such a high rate and where the economy is booming , it seems that the world has somewhere lost the meaning of helping others .
The present youth is more actively involved in making fast money in order to enjoy a life filled with luxuries .
People have indeed become more selfish and self-centered and do not think twice abt taking out some time from their lives to help their communities or the underpriviliged .

I am indeed very ashamed to admit that the youth of the present generation does not involve itself in any social or charitable work .
The youth needs to tighten their buckle and needs to start acting upon this grave matter .
It is often seen that the youth filled with its raw and uninhibited passion and spirit is able to change the world and make a noticeable difference .
The youth has indeed forgotten its responsibilities and duties .
I would like to expalin the above by illustrating the fact that many youngsters spend whopping amounts of money on celebrating their birthdays and other occasions .
What i would like the youth is to spend some time with their grandparents and elderly relatives or do some type of charitable work on their date of birth if they find it too taxing to do it on a regular basis .
In doing so , they indirectly play a very imprtantrole in shaping a healthy and ultimately a prosperous nation .
Setting up awareness camps in rural or underdeveloped areas canhelpspread awareness about various diseases and the like .
Such efforts can induce people to be more cautious about their health-and being healthy can ensure a better chance of survival .

The youth can help its communities in every effort they put in .
For example , recently my elder sister organised a blood donation camp and a rally to spread awareness about female foetacide on the eve of Gandhi Jayanti .
Her heartfelt efforts attracted many students and even faculty memebers of her college .
All of them took part very passionately and indeed helped spread awareness in our small town .
Similarly .
i feel very strongly that the youth needs to take varoius steps in this particular direction so that it can improve the standard of living of their communities and help work towards a more prosperous AND DEVELOPED NATION

"The young boy helped the old lady cross the road .
This is the stereotype on how the youth help their community is based .
According to me this extremely unfair .
The world has evolved and with it so should the defination of helping your community .

The youth of today contrary to general opinion are not so different from the youth of yester years .
We may express ourselves in a different way which may or may not be acceptable to society but at heart we do care for our friends , family and yes even our community .

A vast majority off all social , environmental development drives are carried out by the youth .
The soal purpose of these drives is the betterment of our communites , our society on a whole .

For instance in my school we carried out a `` Say no to Fire Crackers '' drive .
In my country the festival of Diwali is a grand affair which is celebrated with great zeal and vigour .
Bursting mind boggling amounts of fire crackers is a part of the festival .
These firecarcker are made by poor children as the are a cheap source of labour .
My not supporting the booming fire cracker industry we not only aided a social cause but also majorly decreased the excessive pollution linked with the festival .

The youth of today may be caught up in their own issues but that does not we sacrifice the welfare of our communites .
It is not uncommon to see child picking up a wraper or can from the road and throwing it in the nearest bin .
We still carry out our responsibilities as proud citizens of our respective countries .

My school bus had stopped at a crowded intersection on my way back home from school .
A motorcyclist on our side of the road dint mangae to break in time hit an on coming car and fell of his bike .
Our bus driver saw the man fall and decided not to stop the bus as he felt other would come to his aid .
One of my seniours ( i was in 7th grade ) though immediately told the driver to stop the bus and ran to the injured motorcyclists aid .
He told the bus driver to conitue on and took the cyclist to hospital in a taxi on his own .

This was just an example of somthing which is quite commonplace in todyas world .

"I strongly disagree with the statement that today 's youth does not spend enough time on helping the community .
The spirit of helping others , especially those who are in need , together with the sense of compassion , is not limited by age .
There are several organisations that are dedicated to hepling the community that are organised , managed and run by the youth alone .

A closer look at the records of voluntary community service in most American hospitals reveals the major portion of its participants to be in the 12 to 25 age category .
This could be attributed to the fact that younger people have a larger number of free hours to indulge in community service , compared to adults who have work and family responsibilities .

The recent tsunami on December 26th , 2004 , that wreaked havoc on the South East Asian coastline resulted in unprecedented death and destruction .
A large number of humanatarian organisations theat provided relief to the victims were youth and student organisations .
These international as well as local youth organisations campaigned to raise money and distributed relief material and compensation to the affected victims and also pitched into the rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts .

The United Nations has a special youth wing that holds an annual forum , providing a common platform for the youth to meet , discuss issues relevant to them and finally act on them .
Had young people nowadays not been interested in these causes , such an organasation would neither been endorsed nor been given assistance .
A peek into every activity involving community service , be it in donations for needy causes , rehabilitation of underpriviledged children or animal welfare , the youth is not just present : it is actively involved .

In conclusion , I would like to say that the young people of today have not lost their concern or forgotten their obligation to society .
They strive to put in as much time and effort as possible to the cause of upliftment of the society .
They do their bit and more to help their community and make the world a better place to live in .

"I support the argument that young people do not give enough time helping their communities .
In today 's context and scenario the concept of benevolence and brotherhood no longer exist .
The youngsters these days have become so obsessed with the materialistic pleasures that they tend to overlook or appreciate the environment they have been brought up in .
They are part of a rat race and constantly competing with their contemporaries so as to get ahead of them .
They seem least bothered when it comes to actually doing something for the benefit of someone else .
It is the `` I , Me , Myself '' scenario that prevails today .

I can say from personal experience that the essence of belonging to a community is lost let alone helping others !
In the stranglehold of societal demands , we are all subjected to just working for ourselves , to achieve as much as possible - more perhaps , if achievable !
Its all about goals , targets and results .
We seem to have forgotten that at the end of the day , we , the human race must live in cooperation and share a symbiotic relationship with every other being .
We must learn to ` give ' and not just ` take ' - For the sake of morality if nothing else !
But morals and principles are a thing of the past , long gone and forgotten .

We tend to forget that only when we give something do we get something in return .
But again , just for our own selfish reasons we must not resort to helping anybody else .
The realisation must come from within , it must be like an awakening that would lead us to helping others , sharing with others and creating an amible and comfortable environment .
As citizens of a community , it is our responsibility to give other members their due .

It is indeed the need of the day to reinstute the values of helping others for the upliftment of society and the entire human community .

"Society has always been divided in two groups , one that of more experienced , but sedate older generation and the other that of a more enthusiastic and ripe newer generation .
I do not agree with the opinion that the present generation does n't give sufficient time to help their communities .
Infact , the youth of today provides a very balanced and fundamental support to its society .

Young people have always been the main source of the enthusiasm and interest for the activities carried out by their communities .
Infact they are the one who takes initiative and drive others out of their home .
For instance , the No War Propoganda , to protests against the war by US on Iraq and Afghanistan were not only dominated but initiated by groups of college and high school students .
They were the one who took the responsibility to unite the society to stand and voice its opinions .

Young people have more time , space and entusiasm to participate in social programs .
Unlike adults who are too engrossed in their mediocre family problems and commitments , younger generation provides a more committed interest and a promise to fulfill its task .
Hence , its always the younger generation that ends up in helping out the society .
For instance most of the latest discoveries and inventions are made by the young assosciated of scientist and professors .
Though its been under the supervision of the scientists its those young shoulders on whose basis the scientists can claim the accolode .
They devote them selves to the benefit of human race .

Young people have always been the major recruiter in the army .
Its the younger people who do understand their resposibility and do join armed forces to the service of their community .

Young people provide the innovation needed to do things in a newer and more effective ways .
They do provide oppourtunities to others to share , help and protect each other .
To illustrate the point , several young boys and girls do participate in welfare , charity , marathons , processions , seminars , public debates , etc. to help society .
They provide a feeling of brotherhood , a feeling of togetherness , a sense of unity lacking in a group of adults .

In short , its the younger generation of today thats been more responsible and more approaching to a community as compared to its older assosciates .

"The communitiy gives an environment that helps us to learn , grow and progress in life .
Therefore helping the community is an important responsibility of every citizen .
However , we freqeuntly find young people of the current generation not giving enough time for the benefit of the community on account of varied reasons such as lack of availability of time , lack of awareness , etc .
But , I feel that many young people do work for community service in some form .

Increased competition and complexity besiege the life and career of many young people of the current generation .
Young people are busy advancing their personal goals in life and seldom find time for community service .
Many-a-times lack of awareness about options available for community service in a area leads one to not give enough time for community service .
We find numerous examples of people of such kind .

However , to conclude that all young people do not give enough time to community service would not be appropriate .
There are several organizations like the `` Yuva '' in Mumbai which are channelizing the efforts of the young people interested in community service .
The number , membership and work of such organizations is growing .

Also , there a lot of young graduates these days who choose community service as a career option even when they have to accept lower salaries .
Increase satisfaction serves as their prime motivation .
Besides , especially in India , I see a lot of people choosing civil service option with an objective of serving the society .

Thus , we see a mixed trend in the dedication of the young people of the current generation to their communities .
On one hand , we find young people who are completely selfish and do not care about community , while on the other hand we find those that dedicate themselves for community service .
Most of the people stand some where in between .
On the whole , I find that the awareness about , interest in , and efforts towards community service are increasing .

"I completely agree with the statement .
Today 's young generation hardly gives any time to help their community .
I feel so because , I have observed this .
I feel if this continues , it may result in the decreasing growth of country .

I had free time last weekend .
So , I was roaming around in the city .
The very obvious thing which I could observe everywhere was , teenagers dancing around in pubs , drinking , gaming , playing music .
At the same time I could see people starving for food in slum areas next to them .
But , they were not bothered at all .
I felt really bad and asked myself if this is the generation which is going to run this country in coming years ?
Our country 's future is in these hands waving unbothered in pubs ?

Having fun , enjoying with friends is not a bad thing to do .
But , one should always realize that there is a big mob of people around you seeking your help .
Bringing a smile on their face would surely add a lot to your community .
The young generation can always spend few hours per week to help their community .
They should realize their need for their community .
They should realize that the future of their country is in their hands .
Helping out the community is very crucial for a country because , the country grows with the development of community .
The implied meaning is , the teenagers giving more time for helping out the community is crucial because , they can always utilize some portion of the time which they spend hanging around .

There are many organizations formed by group of young people in order to help out the community .
But , the teenagers hardly know about them and they often do n't pay attention at these things .
I think , we should make today 's young generation realize the importance of community services by publicizing such organization and letting young people to participate more in their activities .

Finally , I would say , the enthusiasm young generation should not waste their energy by hanging around .
They should contribute to the country 's development by giving enough time to help their community and make the country grow with them .

"The given statement is a cynical and skeptic comment which is thrown at every generation .
I can say with great pride that my generation can annul this cynicism in a number of different ways .

In my own university we have a number of different activities through which we can contribute to our communitity .
All these activities come under the banner of what is called the National Service Scheme or NSS for short .
I myself am a volunteer of this organisation and thus vehemently oppose the given statement .

There is a wide range of ways in which we volunteers contribute to our community .
Every six months we organize a blood donation camp in our university in which students , faculty as well as people living close to the university come in great numbers to donate their blood .
Recently , I was also part of a successful project to assist the gardeners in improving the condition of trees in our campus .
Every alternate day around thirty students would spend the evenings watering the existing trees , pruning them , removing weeds and also planting new trees .
We even managed to arrange for a water tanker to accompany us , thus saving the burden of carrying buckets all over the campus .
Our efforts over the past semester have paid off and the gardeners have now indicated that extra help is not required as the overall condition of trees has improved .

Other students who enjoy teaching have taken up a project in which they devote part of their time to interact with and teach blind children in a blind school in our city .

The people who lament the decrease in such social activities among the youth should make a closer examination which will reveal that the youth social organisations are alive and flourishing .
Some of the graduates from my university have taken this community service to the next level by adopting it as their profession .
This has manifested itself in the form of Non Governmental Organisations which are non-profit organisations whose aim is improving some aspect of society .
NGOs can work towards providing safe drinking water to villages to working for the betterment of the lives of the elderly .
Young people with a passion for changing their societies are forming such organisations and are doing great wonders for their communities .

"I completly agree with this statement that `` young people nowdays do not give enough time yo helping their communities '' .
The younger generation nowdays spend most of their time enjoying themselves , not very affected by whats goin on withing their community .
They are to busy enjoying their quality time on uneccesary thing .
They do not understand the importance their communities have and how it could benifit them by being a important part of it .

A community basically gives the a child or young people some important moral values which they do not even recive from their parents .
These communities give the student the basic needs to live in a society .
They teach them how to behave in diffrent situations which could help them in their future .
Young people should alwase be a integral part of their communites and help them in what ever aspect .

These communites also take part in varios activites such as relif funds etc. for the needy people affected by varios disastors like an earthquake or a hurricane .
Young people should take an initiative in such activites and help their communities in perfrorming their important tasks since it will be benifical not only fer the needy and the poor but also for an individual himself , since it will bring in him an important quality of helping which is very important fer every human being .

These young people should take some time off from their normal activites atleast once or twice a week and spend some time with their communities and work with them and make it a better community .
But on the other hand these communites should also include some interesting activites like sports and games , which is sometimes fun and could enhance the participation of young people in them .
Thus the communities could me made more intersting by having such activties .
By this way they could promote their communites more and more and increse the number of young people joinng them and helping them to make the community a better place .

"In this flat world , which has seen some great advancements made in the last decade , things have changed rapidly .
The world has gotten competetive and everyone is trying to outdo others and grow at a faster pace .
Work hours have gotten longer , and people have little or no time even for themselves and their families .
if you ca n't stand out , you are left behind , and no one wants to be left behind .
Things are very different today than they were , say , 50 years ago when people took up one job , and were happy to work for the same company for the rest of their lives .
It not like things were very easy back then , but they were nothing like what is going on in the world at the moment .

Today 's youngster knows that in this ever changing world , if he does n't outperform himself everytime , he will be outdated before he even knows about it .
This change in lifestyles and work enviroment has added lot of stress and pressure on todays youth .
However , I do not believe that this means that the young people today are not giving back enough to their comunity .
They may be short of time , but they try to make up for in different way .

There are NGOs where people like to donate part of their weekends , so that they can work with the poor and the deprived .
There are people who make up for this lack of time by donating money to efforts that they believe in .
Bill Gates , world 's richest man , is relatively young , and one of the biggest philanthrophists the world has seen .
He has pledged his wealth for various causes , and his wife runs a foundation that tries to help out with various problems in third world and developing countries .
A lot of Indian/Chinese expatriates , living in the US , are young and successful .
They probably have not been able to spend enough time for their comunities back home .
But does that mean , that their contribution to the society is nothing ?
Besides obvious things like sending money back to India/China ( which can be used for the welfare of the community ) , they have helped develop an image for the country , as that of a nation full of talented and hardworking people , which has played an important part in taking their country to the next level in this competitve world .
Thus even though they did not spend a lot of visible time helping their community , it was the fruit of their labor that the community and country bore .

"I would agree with this statement .
I feel that young people nowadays are negligent towards their own community as a whole , a community that has helped them become what they are .

There are many places where we see this happening .
Young people are more career oriented now and tend to leave their homes and communities in pursuit of higher edcation and better job opportunities in foreign lands .
Although they may get what they seek but their communities are getting neglected .
Young people are adverse to becoming a part of the social community gatherings and therefore are not exposed to the problems being faced by them .

In my native city in North India I have seen that my community has gone from bad to worse in terms of their social standing and the economic condition .
The community school that I studied in is now in a state of utter disarray .
The older people are trying to do what they can but the onus is on the younger ones to take on the responsibilty .

Local community welfare societies for redressing the problems of people have increasingly seen decline in youth participation .
The young people fail to identify with the problems of people they once lived with .
These socities are for most of the time non-government affiliated organisations and are usually not profitable .
This is why people shy away from them .
They are against spending time on things which are not a source of income .

Young people also feel that whatever time they get at home from the fast paced life they lead should be utilized in spending time with the family rather than worrying about their community .
Lucrative jobs in multinational companies where there are tough working hours as opposed to just a 9 yo 5 job have only worsened this problem .
Attending parties at night and being seen in high places have become more important because of peer pressures and forming profitable social circles .

Another reason for this to happen is that in many places there isnt a common forn for poeple to raise issues concerning them .
Even if they are talked about in very localised areas they are mostly kept away from the reach of younger people based on the notion that their young and immature minds will not understand the problem or be able to provide solutions .
In most gatherings in my native city young poeple are not allowed to express their opinions freely .
This is more so because the old people running the system are against novel ideas .
This also gives the young people a reason to stay away .

Until the people identify with the problems or face them first hand it is highly unlikely that they will ever start worrying about the betterment of their communities .
Steps will need to be taken by both young and the old in developing more practical ideas based on changing society and living standards .

"The topic herein holds great importance as it has to deal with the youth , future mentors of any society .
I believe that the young people these days are not giving enough time to develop and upbring their communities .
The young generation has become much more careless towards their communities as they are already so occupied with several other things which are of more importance to them .

Firstly , the increasing competition to earn a better living has taken away all their extra time that they would have devoted in heping their communities .
These young people are focussing these days on the need of earning a better living , better education , better standing in the society and all the other related things .

Secondly , with the increasing property rates , food costs and prices of other daily living needs , these people have become more money minded .
Hence , instead of giving free time for the upliftment of their communities , they can devote that time either to earn some extra bucks or to enjoy life with what they already have .
The time given for community may not yield any instant benefit to them , hence , the time is spent in an activity which will give them immediate results .

Thirdly , in the upliftment of their community , they may also have to spend some money alongwith time , which makes them bit more reluctant to indulge in any such activity .
These days , such activities can be related to charity and if someone has lot of money , the area of donations .

Lastly , I feel that the young generation nowadays are trying to adapt to the new economic situation which has a lot of significance for leading their future life and creating a good environment for the future generation .
They are a part of the changing world which has changed a lot over a period of time and is changing constantly with a faster pace .

"I disagree with the statement `` Young people do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
You can find youngsters doing commuty services at college , at the welfare clubs and anywhere they find themselves needed .

College is main area of such service centres .
They have their own groups there that does works like collecting funds from students for a worthy cause , or conducting any event , may it be cultural or academic to raise the money for a need .
I would like to quote something related to the recent `` tsunami '' attack that killed lives of many .
There were casualties and loss of properties and the poor people who live in coastal regions were badly affected .
Our college group , who wanted to help the victims , raised a `` Contribute some and Save them '' event to raise money , and it colleceted a gross amount nearing eighty thousand .
It would be small , when only one college is considered , But when all the colleges in that area are considered its a substantial sum .
Its even amazing how much such events in colleges throughout the country would have acquired .

Another instance to quote is the recent `` Blood Donation '' camp that was organised by the youth club in my locality .
The event was done with guidance and it was a huge success .
People , mainly youngsters - both boys and girls participated whole heartedly .
And it surely would save lives .

Not only at college or residential area , even at our workplace such services occur frequently - may be blood donation camp , may be raising money for a cause , or maybe visiting a hospital or an orphanage .
These visits include spending time the children in orphanage and making them smile and doing cultural perfomances to give them a good time .
Or hospital visit - majorly to help in soothing the patients and hearing their problems .
Both visits end up in donations being made to them .

These show that youngsters are doing community services very good .

"I agree with the statement that most advertisements tend to make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements are carefully crafted to manipulate consumer perception and create a desire for a product, often exaggerating its features and benefits.

One reason for this is that advertisers have a vested interest in maximizing sales, so they may use tactics such as selective editing, lighting, or even misleading claims to make a product appear more appealing than it actually is. For example, a fast-food commercial may show a burger looking plump and juicy, but in reality, the burger may be much smaller and less appetizing.

Furthermore, advertisements often focus on the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or omitting any negative aspects. This can create an unrealistic expectation for consumers, leading to disappointment when the product fails to live up to the hype.

In conclusion, most advertisements are designed to persuade consumers to buy a product, often by presenting an idealized version of reality.

"In today's consumer-driven world, advertisements play a crucial role in shaping our perceptions and influencing our purchasing decisions. However, the question of whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is a complex one. In my opinion, I agree with this statement to some extent.

Advertisements are designed to highlight the positive aspects of a product while downplaying its flaws. This can create a skewed perception of reality and lead consumers to believe that a product is far superior than it actually is. For example, a fast-food commercial may showcase a perfectly crafted burger that looks appetizing and delicious, but in reality, the actual product may look quite different and may not taste as good as depicted in the advertisement.

Moreover, advertisers often use persuasive techniques such as emotional appeals, celebrity endorsements, and exaggerated claims to make their products more appealing to consumers. This can create unrealistic expectations and lead to disappointment when the actual product fails to meet those expectations.

While it is true that many advertisements tend to exaggerate the qualities of a product, there are also instances where advertisements accurately represent the product's features and benefits. It is essential for consumers to approach advertisements with a critical mindset and not take everything at face value.

However, it is widely debated whether most advertisements tend to exaggerate the qualities of products, making them appear much better than they really are.

One of the primary reasons behind this assertion is the inherent nature of advertising - which is to sell. Advertisers often resort to persuasive techniques such as emotional appeals, celebrity endorsements, and exaggerated claims to capture the audience's attention and drive sales. But, do these tactics always align with the true essence of the product? 

Consider skincare commercials that promise flawless skin within days of using their products. Are these claims substantiated by scientific evidence, or are they merely marketing gimmicks? Similarly, fast-food ads showcase mouth-watering burgers that look nothing like what you receive in reality. Do these glamorized portrayals accurately represent the product's taste and quality?

Furthermore, the rise of photo editing and digital manipulation has made it easier for advertisers to create an idealized version of their products that may not reflect reality. In a world where perception is often more powerful than reality, it is essential for consumers to approach advertisements with a critical mindset.

For instance, a fast-food commercial may showcase a mouth-watering burger that looks nothing like the sad reality you receive when ordering it.

Secondly, advertisements often rely on emotional manipulation rather than factual accuracy to persuade consumers. They create a desire or fear in the viewers' minds, convincing them that their product is the solution to all their problems. This can lead to disappointment when the actual product fails to live up to the lofty expectations set by the advertisement.

Moreover, the pressure to compete in the market drives companies to exaggerate the benefits of their products to stand out from the competition. This results in misleading claims and false promises that deceive consumers into believing they are purchasing something far superior to what they actually receive.

Firstly, advertisements serve as a platform for companies to showcase their products in the best possible light. This is a common marketing strategy aimed at attracting consumers and standing out in a competitive market. Highlighting the strengths of a product does not necessarily mean exaggerating its features or performance.

Secondly, advertisements often provide valuable information about a product, including its specifications, benefits, and intended use.

Moreover, many advertisements are regulated by advertising standards authorities to ensure that they are truthful and not deceptive. Companies can face penalties for making false claims or exaggerating the qualities of their products.

Whether it's a skincare product promising flawless skin or a fast-food chain showcasing a mouth-watering burger, ads often create an idealized image that may not always align with reality. How many times have we purchased a product only to find it falling short of the captivating promises made in the commercial?

Moreover, the use of carefully curated visuals, persuasive language, and celebrity endorsements can create an illusion of perfection around a product. Companies invest significant resources in marketing campaigns to captivate consumers and drive sales, sometimes at the expense of complete transparency about the product's actual benefits or limitations.

Consider the implications of advertisements promoting fad diets or miracle supplements that claim unrealistic results. Are these products truly as effective as depicted in the ads, or are they preying on our insecurities and desires for quick fixes?

While not all advertisements misrepresent products, it is crucial for consumers to approach marketing messages with a critical eye. By questioning the authenticity of claims and researching beyond what is presented in ads, we can make more informed purchasing decisions.

In conclusion, while advertisements serve as powerful tools to influence consumer behavior, it is essential to recognize the persuasive tactics at play.

"I agree with the statement that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the qualities of products, making them seem much better than they actually are. Advertisements are crafted to entice consumers and drive sales, often by emphasizing the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or even concealing its drawbacks.

One reason for this phenomenon is that advertisers aim to create a strong emotional connection with consumers, playing on their desires and aspirations. For example, a fast-food commercial may depict a mouthwatering burger that looks much larger and juicier on screen than what is served in reality. This manipulation of visuals and messaging can lead consumers to have unrealistic expectations about the product.

Moreover, companies invest significant resources in marketing campaigns to differentiate their products from competitors and boost sales. In this competitive landscape, there is a tendency to highlight only the best features of a product while ignoring or glossing over any potential downsides. For instance, a beauty product ad may promise flawless skin without mentioning the potential side effects of using the product.

In conclusion, while advertisements serve as a powerful tool for promoting products, consumers should approach them with a critical eye and not take all claims at face value. Being aware of the persuasive techniques used in advertising can help individuals make more informed purchasing decisions based on their actual needs and preferences.",P4,HIN,high,1

Advertisements serve as a platform for companies to showcase the unique features and benefits of their products to attract potential customers. They often use creative strategies to make the product stand out in a competitive market. However, this does not equate to making false claims or misrepresenting the product.

Moreover, advertising standards and regulations in most countries strictly prohibit companies from making false or misleading claims about their products. Advertisers are required to provide accurate information about the product to ensure transparency and consumer trust.

In fact, many advertisements rely on customer testimonials, reviews, and endorsements to build credibility and showcase the genuine satisfaction of users. These elements help in providing a realistic portrayal of the product's performance and quality.

Furthermore, advertisements frequently use visuals and language that evoke strong emotions in consumers, leading them to make impulsive purchasing decisions based on these emotions rather than rational thinking. For instance, a perfume ad may feature a glamorous celebrity wearing the scent, creating an aspirational image that convinces consumers that buying the perfume will make them feel just as glamorous and desirable.

"I totally agree with the statement .
The basic purpose of an advertisement is - publicity .
And the more flashy an advertisement is the better publicity it attains .

It all derives from the fundamental rule of business and marketing , that is , making profit .
when a product is launched into the market , stress is laid on how wel it is advertised so that it catches the attention and interest of the masses and not on how wel it is going to stand upto their expectations .
So the ground rule laid for the advertising companies is to make the advertisements ( or ` ads ' as it is more preferably addressed ) as luring as possible .
And hence , most of the times the ads end up promising much more than what the products actually deliver .
On quite a number of occasions the ads have been found guilty of misleading the masses .
They lead people to believe how safe and benefitial the product is when actually the safety front has been compromised .
The recent decline in the number of people indulging in soft drinks after some toxic chemicals were found in their contents is a good example of how the advertisements blow the products out of proportion .
In order to make huge profits every product is depicted as an ideal one but the the flaws only start appearing after a while when it is actually used for a period of time .
the sad part is they prey on the most comely bait i.e. the common people .
They are the one who have to bear the brunt of all the false claims made in the advertisements .

Making advertisements is a very innovative work its true , but it should never compromise on its ethics which on most number of occasions it does .
It should always be kept in mind that in a way it is also a means of serving the people as it lets them know about the things that are available to them and that can make their lives better in one way or the other .
Today most of the advertisements do not seem to realise this and are evasive of their responsibility towards the people and the society .

"I do agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This I concluded from my own personal experience , and the personal experiences of my relatives and friends .

I have , on several occassion , actually purchased , a whole range of products , like lipstick , soaps , detergents , clothes , etc , after having seen them being advertised on TV .
But on most occasions , I was not happy with the product in hand , they simply did not match the quality that they claimed in the advertisement .
In a leading brand shampoo advertisement , for example , It was claimed , that the regular use of the shampoo for a months time , would lead to the complete dissapearance of dandruff .
Believing this claim , I bought the shampoo for my self , and used it as advised .
But the results , were very un satisfactory , after its use not only did the dandruff problem continue to persist , it had in fact much worse than what it was before it 's use .
Similarly , a leading health drink brand , in its advertisement claimed that , this was , by far the best health drink availble in the market , and it tastes much better than any other brand .
Falling pray to their claim , I changed my brand of health drink .
I purchased this , Instead of the one that I had been using for a long time .
To my surprise , I found almost no differece between the two brands , not only this , there was no added health advantage I recieved form the usage of this brand , which I did not recieve from the usage of the earlier one .

My relatives , friends , and many of you as well will have similar experiences to recount .
Indeed advertisements make tall claims about the products , and they have ways to make their products look much better than they actually are .
For example , let us talk about a leading brand energy bar advertisement .
In this add they show a well built athlete , on the race track , sand claim that we can be like him we use the energy bar .
But some thinking will tell us , that there is nio way of guessing how the athlete got his health .
A sneak into the athleats personal life will tell us that .
Not the add

Advertisement , should not be belived , they are there to sell products , and to do that they can go to any extent to make thir product look better than those of their competitors .
As a result of which most end up making tall claims about the product and make the consumer buy these .
After susequent use the consumer realises the product is not as good as it was claimed in the advert

"Advertisements , The Truth or False Exaggerations

Nowadays advertisements make products seem perfect and without any flaws .
But do these advertiements actually show the product 's true quality and worth ?

Recently I saw an andvertisement of a soap product that said that the soap would kill millions more bacteria and germs as compared to other soap products when used .
It stated that it contains certain chemicals , which had long and very `` flashy '' names .
Howewer this was not an exact detail , as even sunlight can destroy millions of germs and bacteria .
Later out of curiosity I checked the ingredients on the wrapper , And I saw that the ingredients were actually the same in almost every soap product of the similar type .
Another example is present within a soft drink company in India .
Several official reports stated that the product contained alarmingly high levels of pesticides , while the company continued to broadcast an advertisement which said that the drink had 0 % pesticides and was perfectly safe for human consumption .

Another advertisement was once brodcasted about a stock market fund .
It stated almost nothing about the risks involved in the investment , but only a very fine print at the bottom saying `` this investment is subject to market risks , please read the offer document carefully before investing '' .
The only thing it showed was celebrities saying that they would invest in the fund as they felt it right .

This is only a few of of many examples that a lot of people experience .
The truth is that the producers or the advertising Co. only want their product to be sold , irrespective of the truth about the product

Howewer this does no mean that all advertisements lie about their products .
Certain advertisements not only state the plus points about their products , but also the negative things , such as side effects , risks etc .

To conclude it can be said that , in the end it only depends on the consumer 's judgement to choose the product wisely and not fall for the exaggerations made by advertisements .
",P4,HIN,high,0
"The issue at hand is '' Do advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are ?
`` .
Yes , I strongly agree with the above point .
In today 's developing world media and advertisements do play in major role in enhancing the product .

Firstly the general public or the customers who are buying or going to buy a particular product are attracted by the advertisement of that product rather than the quality and the performance .
Advertisements are done with famous people which attracts many of their fan 's and they start using that particular product .
For example if a actor is using a particular brand of perfume then his/her fans do follow him without actually considering the quality .
In this way i feel most advertisements make product seem much better than what they really are .

Secondly most of the advertisements contains graphics and high resolution videos and images .
They are visually more appealing and attractive to look at .
Due to the use of multimedia technology more and more clients get attracted and buy the product instead going for their properties and long lasting nature .
For example in an advertisement its shown that a bicyle ( product ) collides with a bus and nothing happens to the bicycle which is not at all possible .
So again advertisements seemed to make products much better than what they really are in real life .

Thirdly advertisements lead to the increase in the sales of a particular product whether it is really good or not .
Many companies use advertisements to increase their sales of product .
Their main aim behind is to earn maximum profit .
Furthermore many of the firms use advertisements as an intelligent weapon to show superior features in their product when compared to the product of different firm , so that the customer is tempted to buy their product .
So i strongly feel that advertisements enhances the product than what really it is .
",P4,HIN,high,0
"I strongly agree to the statement that the advertisements ( Ads ) make the products much better than the actual product .
The ads and promotional campaigns are promoting the products to increase their sales and get enough profits but they never take the account of the consumer and its adverse effects on the users .

The daily use products like toiletries and food products , their ads are so tempting that a layman just want to buy them .
The ads promotes the products with all those qualities which may not present .
Some time they make the image of the product as it has all super qualities and it is the ultimate solution of all your problems , for example the hair care products .
Now a days a lot people are suffering with the hair problems and the companies are promoting the products that it is over night wonder and you will be changed person in 2 days or 14 days or so .
But is it really true ??
People are just going on the marketing stunts and they buy it with out knowing what are the consequences and side effects of the product .
I know some people who have used these dyes and other hair products and now they are suffering with skin problems , which are developed coz of chemicals present in these products .

Similarly the advertisement companies which are promoting the food products .
They also ignnore some concrete facts about the ingredients of the product or the quality of product .
Recently this truth has been accepted by the Mac Donalds that they are using animal fats in preperation of so called veggy burger .
Also , I would like to mention aboout the recent fact that just two days back a big bread company in England has been accused of not maintaining the standard and quality of food as some glass pieces and hair are found in bread packets .

Thus the consumers should not just believe on the ads as they are for the benefits of the company not for the consumers .
But I would not keep all ads like the promotional ad campaigns run by government and some NGO and societies like WWF , WHO , etc. in to this category .
Their ads are genuine and are purpose fully made for the benefit of society and noble cause .
These promotional ads should be supported and publicisize .

"This is true that most products look better in advertisements than they really are .
In this age of agressive marketing and bullish economy , it takes a monumental effort to successfully launch a product , and then capture a niche for the product in the face of competition from other similar products .

The problem which most of the manufacturers of different products face is that the market for their product is overcrowded with similar products .
So , in order to make a consumer base for their product , the manufacturing companies try to make agressive advertising strategies to make their product look unique and different from other similar products .
They try to rope in celebrities like film stars or sports personalities to work as brand ambassadors and spend a huge amount on making advertisement films .
Also computer graphics , animation and stunt directors are used to make advertisement films depending on the product and its target consumer clientele .

Few examples which we can see are the Cola giants , Coke and Pepsi .
Although the product is nearly the same , they spend a lot of money in making advertisements to look superior and different from each other .
Similarly we can observe advertisements of cars which are literally flying in the air .
All this is a part of a unique marketing strategy , to catch the consumer 's attention and creating a separate niche for the brand .

We should also acknowledge the fact that if the companies do not make the product look better in advertisements , nobody will buy the product .
They will not be able to compete with other similar brands and the product will fizzle out or die .
So this situation of aggressive marketing and making super ads is as much important as that of the making of the product itself .
Any good product cannot survive without look extra - good advertisements .

"On one hand , many people feel that the advertisements create an awareness about the product and product 's features , while on the other hand many people feel that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I also agree that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Due to increased competion in this world , all the producers of a particular product wants to make a claim that their product is the best .
For example , in the cola market , both pepsi and coke claims that their product is the best and contains all the features to make a person happy .
While advertising their own product they also go ahead to criticise the other product .
But the choice of each person varies for a particular kind of product , so I feel that the claim that their product is the best , is over advertisement .

Another example I would like to mention here is about the soap products .
Many soap producers show in their advertisement that due to the usage of their product , a person is looking very young and it is very difficult to guess that person 's age etc .
While making this claim they totally ignore other factors that contributes to this appearance .
A person can not look young by just using a particular soap .
To look young , the person has to eat nutritious food , should exercise regularly and should not have much tensions .
It may depends on lot of other factors too .
But these advertisements totally ignore all these factors .

So I feel that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are due to increased competiton and desire to succeed in the market .
Due to this competion , while advertising the advertiser ignores lot of other factors which contributes to the desired results in the audience .

"I partially agree with the statement that ' Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ' .
I think it is tough to clearly tell whether one absolutely agrees or disagrees .

Advertsements are one of the most important aspects of modern day business .
With so much competition in every field and each idea superior to the other , good advertiment has become absolutely mandatory .
Advertisements help a lot in increasing the customer 's awareness about a product .
With so many products in the market these days , there is no way the manufacturers can reach the people without publicity .

Increased competetion can be cited as the most important reason behind an underlying exaggeration in all the ads today .
If an advertisement is very modest , and explain the flaws as well the qualities , would there be any takers for the product ?
People have so much choice these days , the manufacturers ca n't afford to loose their present customers .
They are always trying to increase their market share .

Advertisements have a deep impact on the consumer 's mind .
He goes to the market looking for a particular product keeping the advertisement in his mind .
It is only the beneficial aspects of the product that draw him there .
An example could be that of luxury cars .
All the ads emphasize on the increased space , better tyres , better suspension , etc .
No one says any thing about the huge monthly installment that would go in to enjoy this luxury .
But thinking from the consumer 's point of view , he will not even go to have a look at the car if the ad is not attractive , leave apart buy it .

But , on the flipside , there are many ads that are very misleading too .
Like , the ads for weight reduction methods .
These manufacturers know that they have easy targets in women or young people in general .
They publicize how someone lost a major chunk of his weight by consuming their pill .
There is absolutely no mention of the side effects of these artificial methods on the body , which may look healthy after losing fat , but can develop other disorders , like reduced in fertility in females , to cite one .

Most of the time manufactureres know their target .
They cash in on the weak points of that target population .
Sometimes these can misguide the people and lead to irreversible losses to them .
By the time the truth dawns on them , its already too late to react .

To conclude , I would say that taking one stand on any one of the two extremes is not fair .
The maufactures should be allowed a little liberty in making claims as long as they are not absolutely unjust or too exaggerated .
But they not let go of their ethical responsibities , and should not go to the extent of causing harm to their consumers just to increase their profits .

"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In fact , I believe that in any mature market , this embellishment of the truth on the part of the advertisements is inevitable .

It all begins from the fact that usually , most companies do n't have the luxury of being in a product space where they have a monopoly .
This means that they are continously competing with each other to sell their products .
This means that they have to constantly innovate to try and make a better product .
But the innovation does n't stop just at the production , it continues into the selling stage and that 's where advertisements come into the picture .

Now in an ideal world , an advertisement would be indistinguishable from the specification of the product .
A company would just state the features of the product in a technically accurate manner and let the buyer decide .
Unfortunately , in the real world , usually , the buyer is a human being , which means that he most probably does n't have the time , patience or even at times the expertise to make a decision based on just the specification .
This means that the information provided to the buyer needs to be summarized into simpler and easily digestable form .
It is this gap between the real specification and the information provided to the customer that advertisements really become an important tool in boosting sales .

Thus while summarizing the information , advertisements give the company the opportunity to smooth over the defects and accentuate the good qualities of the product .
To take an analogy , the same way make-up enhances a woman 's beauty , advertisements enhance a product 's appeal .

Also , considering that only that much can be done to improve sales on the production side ( for example , how much innovation can really be done in a tooth-brush ? )
after some time , advertisements are left as the only viable alternative to push sales .
And once one company starts advertising , the others have to naturally follow which soon degenerates into a rat race of who can bend the truth more .

Therefore , one ends up with ` new-improved ' shampoos where the only thing that has been improved is the label , health equipment which can make you lose weight almost instanteously , and tooth-paste which can land you that dream-job or man .

Infact it is a art that has developed with new era and new technology .
It is a means of atrracting their costumers to buy their product .

Advertising industry has grown for decades and still growing today .
With the invention of computers grafics any product in the market can be made very beautiful and irresistable .
The advertisement is eye catching and it gets registered into your mind .
So when you go to the market , even if the product is not useful , you end up buying it only because the beautiful side of the product has been inculcated into your mind .

Lets take an example of a perfume .
In the advertise the perfume bottle was in a shape of a lady and it was being used by Jenifer Aniston .
T hat had registerd into my mind and i was wanting tho buy the perfume for a long time .
One fine day I finall got a cance to go buy it .
The price of the perfume was unbelievable , it was so expensive .
But i wanted it at the image of Jenifer holding the bottle just di n't go out of my mind , and guess what ?
I finally ended up buying it .
Even today I regret to the purchase that I made that day as till today the perfume bottle is only half used as I no more like its smell .
But that was a lesson for me , and today I keep control on myself and donat get waved away by such fantasies created by the advertisements .

I realize that I am not the only one , there are millions of people who has had this kind of experience .
But the key thing to ask is , do these people realise how they are trapped by the advertisement industry .
I guess there would n't even be 1 % of the entire crowd who understands this strategy used by the advertisement agencies .

"I would agree on the point that most products advertised are not as good as they are portrayed in the advertisements .
The reason for my belief is that the advertising companies get a lot of money from the manufacturers to make their ad look better .
And due to this the make the product look very flash and attractive in the advertisements even if it is the most hideous product .

Advertisement is the best marketting stratergy that decides the sale of the products and the companies success .
In order to ahieve certain targets and to attract more customers the companies advertise their items in a manner that makes them more desirable to the viewers .
To do this they add certain features which the might not be able to provide .
They spend a lot of money on these ads .

For example , a cell phone company X adverstises its phone that has all the features except a very bright coloured handset that might attract people .
So the advertisers usually enhance the colour of the handset in the adds that people like to see .
They modify the product with the help of the computer techniques .
This might be misleading for the viewers of the ad if they order the handset just because of its colour .
Most people believe in what the see in the advertisements and order the products on the basis of the ads .
This can lead to viewers forming a wrong opinions about the products too .

Giving a personal example , i ordered an entertainment book which according to the advertisement had all the addresses of the tourist places in and around newyork but when i finally got the book in hand i discovered that the book had only a few selected place and it did not include all the important tourism spots for eg. the museum of modern arts or the radio city hall in manhattan .
How could any book miss that ?

On the basis of the reasons and examples citied above and on the basis of my experience I would finally conclude that the advertisemnets are often misleading and do not provide the exact information and the viewers should go into the details of the product before buying them .

Advertisements are made to market a product and increase its sales .
The main aim of advertisement is to make the product look very suitable to its potential buyers .
For this , the product must look really attractive .
Sometimes , to achieve this fake objects are used .
For example , the bright red strawberry pieces in the advertisement of a cereal may not actually be the real strawberry .
It may be just brightly painted plastic pieces .
When the advertisement looks very appealing , people get interested in it .
No one would want to buy something that looks dull , uninteresting .

Children are specially influenced by the advertisements .
In the advertisements , the toys appear so real and much better than they actually are .
For example , the spiderman toy seems to jump , fly and save the planet from the bad people .
In reality , it is the child actor who is holding the toy , who is making it do wonderful things .
But to the child who is watching the advertisement , it seems as if the toy is doing things on its own .

Since , first impression can be the last one , many consumers read or watch about the product and instanly make up their mind about the quality of the product .
Unfortunately , still in many countries there are no harsh legal penalties for duping consumers through these false claims and hence , companies are not discouraged from such practices .

Moreover , our modern economy fuelled with competition encourages and somewhat based on `` winning with hook or crook '' theme .
For an example , in USA , many car manufacturers are competiing to gain market and profits .
But the advertisement about their car might not depict the truth about the car .
Advertisements are done such that , the bad qualities about the product are not highlited while the positive points are shown highly in the advertisements .
So in car advertisements , if the car lacks some additional feature like , music system , then it will not be told in the advertisements , on the other hand comparative mileage will be shown as a big plus point against competitors .

Also , the concept of `` real '' advertisement about the products may just boil down to Ethical behaviour .
The companies should be held responsible for double meaning advertisement about the their products which may lead to serious injury or dissatisfaction among the consumers .
Companies advertising the product should not leave the advertisements interpretation to the public .
Lack of information is same as false information in coming up with the conclusion about the product .

I would like to conclude that , yes , advertisements does make the product seems better , and the main root cause behind it is the higly comptitive economy and struggle for existence among companies and products .
But with strignet laws this phenomenon can be curbed and consumers can make correct decission about the product .

"Advertisement is the channel by which a product is displayed in the eyes of the masses for increasing its sellling power to the market as well as the people .
I personally feel that most advertisements are designed to effect people more than its actual worth .

Advertisements nowadays are based on marketing stratagies more than the quality of product itself .
I have had some personal experiences where i fell for the beatifully displayed advertisements and purchased products , only to regret later .
The colors , backgrounds , personal emotions and photography are enhanced to impress the people about the product .

One of the experiences that made me realize that a product is much more than what it is advertized as , is when i bought diet pills by watching a television commercial .
It was a 15 minute commercial where people talked about how the pill worked effectively on them and showed drastic results .
It definitely worked on me emotionally and i ordered the product .
It was an expensive purchase , hence expectations for the results were high .
I folowed the directions and time of usage only to realize that it didnt work without diet and exercise .
There was no difference in how i looked and i was extremely dissapointed .

The commercials on television , radio and newspapers are made more to attract buyers , than to actually display the truth about the quality and the genuineness of the product .
Advanced technology and photography make products look very attractive , even to a point where advertisements are targeted to effect that part of the human brain which would get effected by the way the advertisement has been displayed .

All in all , i believe advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There is always more information about the product that one needs to know besides the advertisement .
The Advertisements is the means to increasing the selling power of the particular product , hence only the positives will be shown .
I believe that laws should be made so that the companies are complied to give the true picture about the product , the good and the bad .

"Advertisements are the bread and butter of today 's commercial market and economy .
They can be best described as the `` necessary evil '' .
Although necessary , they can also contribute to waste of people 's money when they buy things they like on television but realize long after that the product is not at all satisfactory .

As an example , consider an advertisement of a depression medication .
If you watch it carefully you will notice that first it tells you all about its uses and good effects and then it tells you about all the numerous side-effects it can cause .
It is really interesting to note that the side-effects are mentioned really fast and can be overlooked .
And thats the way the advertisement is designed to be .
An advertisement is made to attract people toward the product and if such an advertisement is made for a non-prescription drug , a person may realize all the side-effects once they start using it .

A second example to emphasize the way advertisements can act as a blindfold for the customers , is the promotions for cosmetics .
The way cosmetics are shown to improve an individual 's comlexion and beauty by showing really pretty faces , the advertisements often fail to indicate that the brand being advertised may not suit every skin-type and may be harmful to someone 's genes , causing serious mutations leading to cancer .

But , inspite of these arguments about the way advertisemnts manipulate a customer 's mind , they do make us aware of all the new products in the market and normally if you see carefully an advertisement will definitely tell you all the positives and negatives about the product .
But somehow , it is the nature of human mind to absorb all the nice things , ignore the negativities while watching and then find someone else to blame for their ignorance .

Even though necessary , I still feel that advertisements do make the real product look much better than it actually is because of the way they are designed to take our minds off the problems about that product .

"I am agree with the statement that advertisements generally give wrong information about their products .
If a particular product is launched then genarally companies advertise their product to people so that people buy their product more .
An advertisment expalain about a particular product .
It should tell about the pro and cone of it .
But it can be put into negative use also .
Below I will explain for what kind of product genrally companies give false advertisement .

In competing market generally the company says better things about a product in it 's advertisement .
There might be some competing products , which are already there in the market and a company come up with the same kind of product .
The company tries to sell it 's poduct more .
So in it 's information they genrally put false information about their product so that their product looks nicer than the rival product .
I 'm giveing one example below .

You can see this kind of trend more in cosmetic industry .
Every hair shampoo is more or less same .
They all contain the same amount of chemical in it .
But still every company come up with different advantages of their shampoo .
They says that thier shampoo is more effective that the other .

Sometimes it also happen that company make cheaper product and try to sell them at higher prices .
To do this they make false advertisemnt about their product .
You can see this kind of advertisements for duplicate products .
You can see this when a roaming salesperson come into your home for selling his product .
Gennerally they give wrong information about the product and try to sell them at a high price .

It also happen that sometimes an advertisement says only good things about a product .
They hide away the bad thing .
For an example , say someone wants to sell slipping pills .
The advertisement says that the sleeping pill is good , it will give you a good night sleep .
But that sleeping pill might cause other symptoms also .
The advertisement is not going to tell you about that .

But you ca n't say all of the advertisements give false information .
Some of the advertisement really give helpful information about a product .
We should analyze an advertisement only on it 's true values .
",P4,HIN,high,0
"I whole heartedly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisements are the source for the companies to reach the customers and sell their product .
Advertisements play an important role in forming an opinion about any product .
If the advertisement is convincing enough , the customer will go and enquire about the product or will try the product .
So , to leave a mark on the customer 's mind , the advertisement is made very catchy and most of the times the advertisements become very misleading .
The products are advertised to have so many features but when you actually see the product or use it , you come to know the real features .

When you see an advertisement , you tend to get fascinated by the features mentioned in the advertisement but when you actually see the product , it leads to disappointment .
But the advertisement actually help the company to bring customers to their products ...
For example , I read in a newspaper about a life time free credit card from a leading bank and I actually signed all the documents to get one .
I got my credit card but later I came to know that some money was deducted from my account as the charges for a magazine subscription .
When i asked the officer of the bank , he said it comes as a package with the card .
That instance drove me to frustration .

Another instance is when i bought a shirt of a top brand .
The company advertise the shirt as wrinkle free but when i actually washed the shirt , it was just a normal shrt with lots of wrinkles on it .
Instances like these happened many times .
Advertisements are mostly misleading but these at least help to bring customer to the shop or to sell the product .

Advertisement is a way by which the companies can reach the customers , tell the customers about the products and finally make their market .
So , the advertisements should tell only the real and true qualities of the product .
The misleading advertisements have led to the decline in the number of people watch or pay attention to the advertisements .
In this way , the advertisements will lose their charm and importance soon .

"I agree with the statement that , `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
In this essay I will present a variety of reasons and examples that support my conviction .

The very purpose of an advertisement is to maximize sales of a particular product .
To maximize sales it is imperative to convince people to buy the product and make the product appear much better than it is .

Advertisements highlight the good points of a particular product while neglecting to mention its ' bad points .
Advertisements for new drugs , for instance , often highlight how a particular drug can cure a certain disease while neglecting to mention any side effects that may occur as a result of using that drug .

Some advertisements advertise qualities of the product that are unlikely to be of much use .
However , people may be encouraged to buy the product .
For example , many car advertisements advertise the top speed of car - but who is going to drive a car at 300 km/per hour ?

Other advertisements portray products as they would function under ideal conditions , without describing how they would function under conditions of common use .
For instance , advertisements for mobile phones and other technological items suggest that they can function perfectly for an indefinite time period .
This does not , of course consider the effect of normal wear and tear and entices people to buy them .

The cleverest and often the most successful advertisements make use of subtle psychological tricks to encourage people to buy products .
They do this by ascribing attributes to the product that it may , in fact , lack .
Advertisements for cigarettes are a classic example .
Cigarette users are depicted as fashionable and popular as opposed to those who do not use cigarettes .
No company mentioned the harms of cigarettes until government regulations forced them to do so .
Deodorant advertisements are another example , often suggesting that the male user of a particular deodorant would have women following him left , right and centre !

To conclude then , advertisements aim to maximize sales of products by making them seem much better than they really are .
They do this in a variety of ways - examples of which I have given in the above essay .
",P4,HIN,high,0
"I do agree with the statement that most advertisements do in fact make products seem much better than they really are .
The reasons I think this is true are as follows .

Firstly , most advertisements always highlight positives of the product but do not mention any associated `` cons '' of the product .
Although it is true that without stressing on positives , the product would not sell , but leaving out details do not give complete information about the product .
For example , a Macdonalds advertisement would highlight the `` experience at an afforable cost '' but would not mention anything about the trans-fat content of the products which could have ill-effects on health of the consumer .

Secondly , advertisements use associations to sell a product and leads consumers to believe that acquisition of the product would materialize the association .
For example , the `` Air Jordan '' shoes marketed by Nike sold the association of having the `` ability to play like Michael Jordan '' using the Air Jordan shoes .
We all know that it requires a lot more talent and ability than a pair of shoes to play like Jordan .
Hence , the association always ends up glorifying the true benefit of the product .

Another reason that results in misplaced information about a product given the advertisement is the use of celebrity models in advertisements to sell products .
Even though the product might need a particular attribute in the customer ( for example a fit body ) to be beneficial to the customer , the customer does not sense that on seeing the advertisement .
They rarely recognize that what looks good on supermodels like Cindy Crawford might not necessarily look good on them .

Given the above mentioned reasons , I would agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .

"Cars are one of the most widely used vehicels for travelling today and whether their number will increase or decrease in twenty years is a very polemical topic .
According to me , yes , indeed there will be fewer cars twenty years from now .

Firstly , the pollution caused due to combustion of fuel in the car 's engine is posing grave threats to the enviornment .
Governments and the people are increasingly becoming aware and concerned about this fact and hopfully new rules will be formulated on limiting the number of vehicles a family can own or the the number of cars an office is allowed to have .
People are making concious efforts in reducing pollution due to cars by making car-pools or travelling in public transports such as busses and metro trains .
This way , the number of cars will reduce and more people can travel in the same vehicle instead of each one going seperately in thier own personal cars .

Furthuring my opinion i would like to suggest that the number of cars will also reduce due to the accelerating fuel prices .
The fuel prices are inceasing day by day due to inceasing scaricity of petroleum .
It is a non-renewable resource which is depleting rapidly and thus its scarcity will result into price-rise .
so affording a personal car will become increasingly difficult for the common people .

With the advent of newer technologies such as computers and the internet the basic motive for people to travel is becoming less important .
people can now download their office work on their computers , at home , and can work in the comfort of their homes instead of driving and going to offices .
students can also attend lectures on their computers and submit assignments which reduces their need to travel to schools everyday .
they can interact with their proffesors and peer on the internet through text or voice messages with the help of a computer .

thus i would like to conclude that due to all these reasons cars will become redundant and , if used , will pose a threat to our enviornment and thus will become obselete shortly .

Rise in the living standards of the people and faster life style would be the possible reasons behind this prediction .
people are becoming more and more independent and solitary in their life style so the need for personal cars is going to be more .

There are certain things wich may resist increase of the number of cars in future and one of those is the fuel problem .
The major fuel for cars these days is petrol or other chemicals derived from petroleum .
The amount of fuel we have under oceans etc is expected to last for another 100 years .
so there will be enough fuel for the cars in next twenty years .
but even then other types of fuels such as C.N.G and hydrogen etc are also used by car manufacturers now a days so it would not let the extinction of cars happen .

cars are definetely going to increase in number on roads in next twenty years becase they have been made safer now a days than they were before .
with all this technical advancement and safety experimentation carried out at a war front level new models of cars coming out of the factories in future are going to be very very safe for the drivers .

last but not the least , with all the above reasons , the reason which might be the biggest and the most powerful reason behind increase in car 's population on the roads will be affordability , the mass production and competition in the market is working towards cutting down the prices of the cars so down that the day is not far when even a common man would be able to buy a car of his choie .

"Cars have different meaning for different individuals .
For some its a neccessity , an object insperable .
For others its a status symbol , an object that expresses their power , success and wealth .
What ever might be the perceptions , a car is surely one of the most fascinating objects created by man .

When Henry Ford invented the car , he did not fathom how important it will become in our daily life .

The demand is high and the number of cars being added on the roads is increasing at a dramatic rate .
In the developed countries as compared to the developing countries this rate is much higher .
Some countries take it positively as its an evidence of their economic prosperity .
More cars on the road implies more earning power for a common man .

However , lately the opinion has been changing as people are starting to realise the adverse effects that are being caused due to cars .
One of them being traffic jams which are very common in large cities like New York , London or New Delhi .
A lot of time gets wasted due to this reason , as drivers get stuck in them .
People have surely realised this problem and are preferring car pooling , buses or even bicycles as means of commuting .
This means that in future there is a big possiblity of reduction of the number of cars on roads as the other mediums would mean reaching the destination faster .

One other factor is noise and air pollution being caused by cars .
This is a very big problem for people who live close to a main road where the density of cars is very high .
On the other hand it is also a nuisance for the car drivers or the passengers as the pollution causes harm to their health .
Imagine , monday morning when everyone goes to work , the traffic jams and pollution start the day .
This will surely lead to a decline in the number of cars .

Another strong reason could be the rising fuel consumption which is increasing the fuel prices .
This is making people to look out for alternative mediums to travel .
This will surely lead to a decrement in the number of cars as people would prefer buying a buss pass which would prove to be lighter on their pockets as compared to purchasing fuel for their cars .
Even if an alternative cheap fuel is invented , increase in traffic jams and pollution will definitely lower the number of cars .

Finally , the number of accidents being caused by cars are inreasing day by day .
Due to this reason people are preferring trains and buses which are comparitively safer .

All the major reasons mentioned above will surely bring a drop in the number of cars , and twenty years down the line we can expect fewer cars in use than there are today .

"In the next twenty years there will be much more cars than there are today .
The rate of cars production is increasing drastically over time .
More and more companies in developing countries are venturing up in this field to make more and more fuel efficient cars .
According to current studies for the car market , it is estimated that after 15 years the cars in Asia will be 2 times of what they are today .

This is true that the demand for supply of fuel is also increasing leading to high oil prices .
But many researches are going on for the non-conventional sources of energy .
Many companies like General Motors have now started to produce cars which run on electricity and these cars are very efficient and small in size as well .

If we just look at the use of cars in the past 100 years , we will find that cars have become more and more useful with time , and today it has become a necessity for an average person .
About 70 years ago , one could rarely see a car and the cars belonged to only the highly priveleged rich people since only they had the money in order to buy and maintain cars .
But today one can see the even the college student interested in buying the latest models of cars .

As the world in changing its face over time , this is widely accepted that the pollution and global warming is affecting the environment and so the car makers are becoming more and more conscious for making cars that lead to lesser pollution and are more fuel efficient to agree for more and more stringent environmental norms defined by different governments .
So as the population and awareness is increasing the car production has to increase to meet its demand .

With more and more pace of development and population growth taking place in the developing countries like India and China , the demand for cars is increasing rapidly .
With the increase in the number to such vehicles , the governments are also spending more and more money for infrastructural development like making roads etc .

So in conclusion we can say that the number of cars is bound to increase in the next 20 years .
And with the pace the demand for cars is increasing every day , in future we will be having more and more developed and highly sophisticated cars .

"I fervently agree with this futuristic statement that in twenty years , fewer cars will be in use than there are today .

Firstly , I believe that in the absence of effective and economic solutions to the problem of fuel today , with pollution and traffic on the rise , there is a pressing need to revitalise our public tranport system and take appropraite measures to discourage private transport .
Cars , that are the symbol of private conveyance not only heavily contribute heavily to the increasing pollution in every major city of the world , but is also unnecessarily cluttering up the scarce space that we have left on the earth and its roads .
This also is leading to a disastrous number of road accidents that are the cause of more deaths today than any epidemic or war .
Twenty years from now , I do not see the severity of these problems alleviated unless we take some effective steps as reducing private transport , which I think is inevitable .
In countries of Europe , the private transport even today is minimally used .

Secondly , with globalization all around us , with boundaries of distances , cultures and languages rapidly dissolving , I see the car getting obsolete simply because our needs would be larger .
With technology , I believe that local distances would become inconsequential and cars would give way to more advanced form of travel .
Already , the first space tourist has made a successful trip and is back !

With an Orwellian outlook of the world , I have a dystopic vision of the world ; a world where for stability and efficiency , the state would assume power , where perhaps personal expression is rendered unimporant and the society or the community is primary .
In such a society , the car which is basically a symbol of prestige and status has absolutely no space .

Today , where we stand , with the all pervasive Internet growing beyond limits , in twenty years the world would be more of a virtual community .
You and I would have a more predominant virtual existence than a real one .
Our basic needs to survive everyday , chores that require us to move around on a daily basis would be conveniently done away with with the virtual world .
Believe me , we 'd be thriving on our virtual entity a lot more , depending on it for our daily needs without moving an inch !
What does a car have to do in such a scenario ?

With the above points , I have made a cogent and strong statement asserting that cars have no place in our world twenty years from now .

"In my opnion , the number of cars that are in use today will not be reduced in the next twenty years .
In fact , I feel the number of cars will increase in the coming years .
I agree with the statment because of some valid reasons which are stated below .

Firstly , if we look at other modes of transportation available to general public , there is no other mode of transportaion which is so much comfortable and independent .
One can finsh so many daily activities and save time by having a car .
Travelling by train is not an easy task during peak office hours and if one is little late to the railway station , he or she misses the train and has no other option than to wait for sometime to catch another train .
This has so many other implciations on that persons daily routine .

Secondly , the price of cars are going down daily .
This has made cars easily accessible to the middle class family also .
They can plane to a get a small car which fits there budgets and satisfy there daily needs .
For example , a four seater car in indian market is available for 2 lakhs , which is very less as compared to the price of the same car few years back .

Thridly , there are many activities in daily life which have been directly related to cars .
For example , imaging a person going on a date for the first time .
These couple will not prefer to go in a public bus .
They will prefer to go in the car .
Other example can be , normal mode of transortation all not accessible at all the places .
So , in order to reach some remote places , one has no other option then to go by car .
There many other activities like going for a dinner with family , which can be easliy managed by having a car .

There are some major issues because of increasing number of cars on the roads .
One of them is increase in pollution level in the atmosphere .
This can lead to so many injurious diseases like lung cancer .
But I feel , govertment can plan some other ways to check and control the pollution level .
In my view this can be checked by making laws related to vehicle pollution more strict and punishable .

So , in my opnion the use of cars will increase in the coming years because in present world having a car is not a luxory but a neccessity .

"I cannont agree with the given statement that there would be lesser number of cars , twenty years down the line .
infact according to my insight the number of cars in use would increase considerably in the course of the naxt two decades .

The possible arguements that i put forth would give the reasons as to why i think so .
firstly , talking about the economic choices that we make nowadays indicate that we spend a huge chunk of what we earn on the mordern gadgets which obviously makes our lives more easier .
and talking about a car ..
well that has become one obvious neccesity .
members who are from the same family would prefer a personal car than one being shared among many .
even students who tarvel far prefer thaown cars .
and why not , it increases convinience .

second factor is that its much easier to buy a car now than in the past .
the varoius loans available from banks , facility of paying in installments with small interest rates saves people from investing a lumpsum amount of money all at once .
people with smaller pay scales can afford to buy cars .

this indicates that there could be an increase in the number cars than the predicted decline .
the facrors that could lead to the decline dont seem like a big hurdle to me in the near future .
talking about the hiking price of petroleum which makes one think about the burden on expenditure by owning a car .
well that is hardly a concern to worry about because it can be dealt with prioritising the list of your expenditure .
running a personal car is more important to the present generation than perhaps spending on say ..
subscribing a costly book or buying a painting or even hanging out at expensive places with friends .
the advantage that owing a vehicle offers outweighs the cost of petrol .

the next possible concern which come come into the picture is that of environmental pollution that the fuel could cause. a major concern to all the environmentalists of the world .
well to see the broader picture no government law could prohibit people from buying a car !!
its a personal choice after all and how many of us actually think about this aspect , there are many other issues that the environmentalists could deal with-like defforestations , emmisions from factories contructions , nuclear wars ..
the list could go on .

and moreover the discovery of biofuels , solar powered cars , natural gases which are less hazardous options are now a real possibility .
this could perhaps lead to the manufacture of more cars , cheaper rates that would only lead to the number of cars increasing on the streets .
the increase in number of cars could also lead to heavy traffic jams , congestion , but do we actually mind getting stuck in a traffic jam for maybe a minute more ?
with the building of broader roads , highways , flyovers , multilaned roads would offer a solution .

thus it could be concluded , that by measuring all the issues concerned with the increase in the number of cars , there seems to be a more likely possibilty of increase in their number .

"The question at hand is that `` will there be fewer cars in use after twenty years than there today '' .
The automobile technology has been climbing acclivities of advancements over the past few years .
But at the same time the challenge introduced due to the fast depleting petroleum resources has impeded high hopes of the industry .
But still i would say that the industry would continue to flourish irrespective of the fore mentioned challenge due to several reasons .

The most pressing reason would be the earnest researches in the field of new and renewable sources of energy to substitute of petroleum .
A few companies have already come up with electrical cars while the researchs on the hydrogen cells are speeding up .
These energy sources not only answers the challenges of depleting petroleum resources but also picturises an ecofriendly future generation cars .
This is because the expected emission from electrical or hydrogen cell based cars are much lower than the cars of today .

Although the initial price range of the new generation cars are rated above the cars of today , the running cost is expected to be considerably less .
For example in the case of an electrical car the running cost is all about chargin the cell which would be much cheaper compared to the oil prices twenty years later .
So in the long run the next generation cars would be cheaper than the pesent day cars .

Another important factor is that pocessing a car has become an important part of ones social dignity .
The purpose of buying a car has grown much beyond the sole purpose of transportation .
The hype on the Formula1 racing and automobile exibitions has has influenced people in all strata of the society .
Despite the rise in oil prices the number of car buyers has never looked down .
The media has been quite successful in transforming the once adomant car market into an inelastic senario .

When all the automobile industries have charged up their research sectors and with the existing media hype it is impossible to belive that the auto industry will collapse .

"The issue at hand is whether the number of cars in use will reduce , as compared to today , over the next twenty years .
According to me , this statement is not in harmony with my thoughts .
I think that the number of cars in use will , infact , increase over the next twenty years .

Firstly , using a car adds upto the convenience of an individual .
It reduces the travel time , that is , one can reach his destination earlier in a car .
It also gives comfort to a person during his travel , not stressing him out because the journey .
So , people will think of buying cars rather than wasting time and getting stressed out because of the journey .
This will lead to a considerable increase in the number of cars in use .

Secondly , having a car also adds up to the status of an individual .
Most of the people predict an individual 's personality by looking at the car he drives , that is , the car speaks for the man .
As years pass by , the physical appearance of the car will become more and more attractive , thereby hypnotising people .
This will help an individual to show of his personality by purchasing an appropriate car .
So , people will prefer to buy cars over years in order to create a distinctive appeal over other people .

Thirdly , considering the advancements in vehicle techology , it has become easy for an individual to afford a car .
The modern technology and innovations have brought down the car prices considerably , which now provides an opportunity to the bourgeis class of people to afford a car .
As , we know the major part of the world 's population comprises of the middle class , I think , this will considerably account in increase in the number of cars over the next twenty years .
Also , the recent technology has increased the efficiency of a car to run more miles on comparatively less number of gallons of fuel , that has attracted a lot customers which will again account in the increase in the number of cars in the next twenty years .

Finally , I conclude by saying that , as long as technology and human desire exist the number of cars in use will keep on increasing over time .

"One would be glad to find a single person today who is not worried about the rising gasoline prices , and the burgeoning traffic jams !
The gulf states the major producers of oil have been foreboding for long that they have alreday reached their maximum limit and the produce fo oil is only going to plummet from here on .
All this spells evil for the car manufaturers .

Cars though expensive have some clear advantage over public transport but it is losing this advatnge a fast pace .
Not only are they becoming more and more uneconomical to drive the traffic situation challanges the other advanatges it has i.e. of quicker transport .

Comparing this with a more efficient public transport system which is way cheaper considering the rising gasoline prices and is much more quicker considering the worsening traffic jam situation .
Anyone would be enticed to use public transport rather than use private transport i.e cars .

Necessity is the mother of invention the mans need to move made him invent the car but this is being challanged in a number of ways these days .
Off recently number of companies have started offering option of work at home , univeristies have started courses which are internet learning based .
All this has reduced the need for people to move and hence eliminating the need of cars form our lives .
And as we move from a manufacturing based economy to an information based one the need of the transport is going to decrase further as people would prefer to stay at home and work .

Though there are certain things that might just save the fate of that beatle in your garage , might be an electric car , which might be cheaper to run as we find more and more renewable souirces of energy and might be much smaller in size and hence solving the traffic issue .

"To make a statement , that in twenty years there will be fewer cars then are today , a person would need to be completely unaware of the current scenario in automobile develoment .
Hence , I strongly disagree with the above statement .

The modern automotive story is one that is spending a lot of money on research and development of various new technologies that will ensure the minimum use of petroleum as their energy source .
Although the current notion about the future of automobiles is that once the supply of crude oil / petroleum is exhausted in the next 50 years , all these cars will have to be taken off the roads .

The above reasoning may be true only if the current level of development is stopped right now .
There are considerable number of newer strategies that have already been developed like ` Fuel cells ' , ` Battery Powered vehicles ' to counter the loss of petroleum run vehicles .
These technologies are already in their testing phase of development , and prototypes have already been run efficiently .
Due to the eco-friendly nature of these cars , it is recieving considerable amount of support from various organizations .
This support has contributed highly to the development of such alternate/hybrid technology vehicles .

Further more , looking at the growth of world population , number of people that will use any kind of conveyance to travel daily , easily surpasses all imaginations .
The growth of new world economies like Brazil , India , China , is producing more number of rich people by the day .
The average global spending power of people have increased over the years and one can easily consider that this growth will continue for the years to come .
This spending power gives people the advantage of choosing their own lifestyle - and an automobile is one of the most important part of a comfortable lifestlye .

Hence , i believe that the assumption , that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now than there are today , is not justifiable .
According to me , we may assume that the older cars , technologies will be surely be phased out by better alternatives in the coming years .
The number of cars in use should definately go up than the current number as the number of people commuting daily and their needs keep rising .

"I strongly agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The two main problems faced by people because of more number of cars on roads are the increasing number of traffic jams and the increasing levels of pollution .
People have become aware that its high time to address these two problems right now before it goes out of hand .

People today are aware of the harmful effects of the air pollution on the environment .
One major source of this air pollution is the vehicles .
Harmful substances like carbon monoxide etc. coming out of the vehicles is harming the ozone layer and thus increasing the cases of skin cancer .
Everyone has started realising that if we want to save our future generations then we have to think of alternatives of cars .
And people have started to act on it as well .
For example , in many European countries , we can see that people travel on bikes or on foot than on cars .

In many countries like Singapore , Malaysia .
England etc .
Metro Rail or Tubes have started operating .
The metro rails are laid as a network to interconnect the entire city and it has been proved quite succesful in these countries .
More number of people prefer to travel by metros than by their cars .
You will not find that many cars on the roads there .
Following their example , India has also brought Metro the country and people have started to travel by it .
Because of it , the pollution levels and traffic jams both have reduced .
There are more countries to follow .

In addition to this , petrol prices are sky rocketting making the car travel more expensive day by day .
People are not able to afford the monthly expenditure of the petrol or gas .
Also our oil and petrol reserves are very limited and will get over in the next thirty to fourty years max which will force us to look for other travelling options .

"Although many people believe that the number of cars in use is surely going to increase with time , I believe that in next twenty years we will be witnessing a decline in the number of cars in use .

The first reason that supports my view is the dependence of automobiles on the non-conversable energy resources .
Even in the twenty first century , the automobile industry is still searching for the alternatives of petroleum and gas .
The petroleum reserves beneath the surface of earth is declining rapidly .
This is already acknowledged as a problem , universally .
The energy source is decreasing rapidly and no other alternative is proving out to be a success .
There is a possibility , that in a future we might even see some government regulations that may limit the use of petroleum by automobiles .

Secondly , there are some revolutionary developments in the field of other modes of transportation .
We have metro trains , bullet trains , and even more fascinating choices available already .
And even the attempts of establishing much better means of public transport is going at a good pace .
The Introduction of metro train in delhi , India has already shown signs of people becoming reluctant to use cars .
They are preferring metro over their own private vehicle ( car ) .
Also , the accessibility to almost everything using internet is making people less likely in leaving their home .

As the essay has demonstrated , the use of cars is likely to decline in the future .
The non availability of an alternative for petroleum as a fuel for cars is surely going to effect the automobile industry .
Also , the availability of more attractive and convenient public transport is driving people away from using their own cars .

"`` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
This could be a well said joke .
I totally disagree with the statement .
How is it possible when every quarter a car manufacturer roll out a new model .
Is it possible in the era when a car manufacturer is about to develop and market a car which would be in reach of the common man who currently rides a bicycle .

I wish the statement would have been true but my minds says `` In your dreams '' .
The growth one sees in the automobile market is extraordinary .
There is such a stiff competition all around that even if one of the manufacturer is out , there are 3 other 's who are in fray to capture it and thus increase their customer share .

Let me introduce an example to enhance my claim .
I would consider the Indian market for this .
In India , a decade ago there was only one car giant called Maruti Udyog Limited ( MUL ) .
Even MUL has consolidated its position by throwing out old indegenous players like Hindustan Motors or foreign players like Fiat .
In less than 5 years of gaining supremacy MUL faced stiff challange from local manufaturers like TATA Motors or foreign companies like Daewoo , Hyundai , General Motors , Honda etc .
Cut to 2006 , we see hundereds of car models flooded in Indian market and many more roaring to get in .
In a time when people are saying that globalization is at its best do we see this trend to decline .
No ways !
Its ought to increase .

Let me introduce yet another point to strengthen my argument .
Today the cost of living across the world is at very high .
People are lavishly spending money on the materials they like to posses and belive me this is a trend which is not going to stop .
Generation by generation it has continued and it will do so for the next twenty , thirthy or hundered years .
As a result people will buy cars to show of their status and thus unkowingly support me in my claim .

People may argue my point with the fact that fuels i.e. petrol and diesel are rapidly depleting and with depleting fuel reserves it would be difficult for cars to survive for next tewnty years and thus reducing the number of cars .
But with the advancement of technology , today , market is flooded with hybrid cars which can run both on conventinal fuels as well as electricity .
I agree that this may be expensive option currently but the pace with which technology is progressing and the amount of competition the market has , I see a drastic reduction in their prices .
Once the prices are down how can we stop people from buying cars which would be their best bet in terms of money and in terms of reducing pollution .

Thus , I would reiterate that in the shrinking world of globalization the days are not far when we will be out there buying a small size car to move rapidly between diffrent rooms in our homes .
Now , with such an encrhoachment , do we see that in next twenty years there would be fewer cars .
Again my mind says , `` IN YOUR DREAMS '' .

"Cars are a way of life today .
They spell convenience because they get a person 's chores done much faster .
It is possible to reach any part of the country with the help of a car and the inaccessible areas have greatly reduced but personally i agree with the statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today '' .

Today cars are a very helpful means of getting anywhere and they are incredible convenient .
A person has the flexibility of time while leaving and does not have to adhere to some time like would have been the case while travelling by a public mode of transport .
They definitely help you get to many places and is probabaly the easiest option when you have to make a last minute trip .
But their convenience is out weighed by the crisis cars will face in the future .

Firstly there is the oil crisis .
With the ever rising prices of gas , cars will become a less economically viable option to tons of people .
This along with the ever increasing shortage of gas .
I believe that people will prefer to travel by public modes of transport because they will be more economically feasible and it will serve the purpose of helping them commute .
Shelling out tons of money every month just for gas may not be affordable to alot of people .
With the prices of gas now threatening to cross $ 100 a barrel i fear to think what the situation will be twenty years hence .

Also with the increasing amount of cars and not enough room to drive , people will not want to drive to work or their education place because navigating all the traffic can be pretty tiresome .
Also the place available for driving freely and not through congestion i believe will be limited .
While i was an exchange student my friend from Taiwan told me that because all the roads are always choked with traffic not many people owned cars in Taipei .
They preferred taking the metro or just walking .
I believe with the increasing infrastructural development and increasing population the streets are just going to become more congested .

Hence though the prices of cars might not increase that drastically because they probabaly will increase in proportion with the salaries of people , the maintenance cost of cars will definitely go up .
By maintenance i mean the cost of fuel .
If the cost of fuel rises by a very large extent , which i believe it will because the oil resources are depleting rapidly , cars will not be used often by people .
People will probably opt for commuting to work by public means of transport while using the cars only in certain circumstances .
So i think instead of owning cars people will prefer commuting by buses , trains or even cabs ( taxis ) but not many people will want to own cars beacuse their high maintenance cost along with their depreciation cost would make cars to not be a very wise investment .
They could probably use that money somwehere else where it would reap more benefits .

So in twenty years there will defenitely be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Unless they make more and more cars battery operated and somehow manage to miraculously bring down the amount of congestion on roads to which even today most of the cosmopolitan cities are victim be it London , New York , Taipei , Beijing or Mumbai .

"In twenty years from now the world is going to change drastically in many ways and one of the ways will be the means of conveyance that one is using to commute .
I agree with the fact that the personal means of conveyance like the cars will decrease in number .
People will start preferring public transport means like metro rails , trains , etc .

With the increasing traffic problems in countries especially like India people have started preferring public traonsport like trains to their personal cars .
In a recent survey conducted it was shown that the number of people who prefer trains to their cars have increased by 9 % in the past three years .
Because of the commotion on the streets because of the large number of vehicles if one has to reach a place some 10km away he has to leave an hour ago to reach the place on time while in trains he can reach the place in 15mins .
This saves a lot of his time and he can be sure of reaching the place on time .

Secondly with the increasing awareness for pollution control , the cars that are a major contribution to pollution should be checked .
Pollution control is very essential to control the temperature of the Earth ( Global Warming ) .
The temperature of Earth is rapidly increasing which if continues to rise will melt the Antarctica and then Earth would become extinct .
Pollution is one of the major cause of this temperature increase .
Cars cause a lot of pollution and in order to check pollution the number of cars in the coming years is bound to decrease .
Studies have showed that Earth 's temperature has shown a rapid rise in the past two-three years and it is mainly due to pollution .
The cars play a major role in polluting the air .
So the number of cars on the streeets will soon be controlled .

With the decrease in the resources like petroleum and diesel which will become extinct in few years if not controlled effectively , it is expected that the number of cars on the streets will reduce giving way to public transport that uses electricity .
Cars that run on diesel and diesel and petroleum will reduce in number to put these limited resources to better use .

There are cars that run on electricity but still for other reasons like traffic commotion ; coming twenty years will record a fall in the number of cars .
Time waits for nobody so public transport that saves time will be more in vogue that the cars in the recent years .

"Twenty years from now , i feel that there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .

I personally feel that owning a car is a choice between the question of need and question of luxury .
For most people now a days owning a car is no longer a luxury .
With all sorts of loans and easy installments that have sprouted out of nowhere a common man can easily afford a car .
But the question here is , is it really neccessary that we own a car ?
In India atleast the answer is a yes .
With the unreliability of the public transport systems , and unaccessibilty of some regions by public transports it becomes neccessary to have your mode of transport .
But with the dawn of a new IT era and hence the looking up of the brighter prospectives of the Indian economy , the question of need is slowly diminishing .
Public transport has come back in its new and improved form , be it the local buses or the metros and it is even accessible in the remotest of the regions .
As for the choice of luxury , the ever increasing hikes i petrol prices due to limited access to the petrol reserves would limit it owning of cars to people who can really afford them , and not the general public .

Globally , the importance of pulic transportation has already been concieved of , and has been in practice for decades .
The modern generation being more aware of their environmetal issues of pollution and depleting fossil fuel reserves have aslo further established the need for better and efficient public systems , that would eventually cut out the depenency on personal vehicles for transportation .
Also with the decrease in fuel , the world all over is experiencing a hike in the prices of fuel which would make it more easier on the pockets of the common man if he used public transportation .
With the ever increasing awareness of the lack of fossil fuel supplies that run most of the automobiles combined with the fact that the emissions from automobiles constitutes a major reason for the increase in pollution in recent times , I feel that the people would start depending on public transport instead of their personal vehicles .

Even though the possibilty of using alternate sources of fuel in the near future exists , its not going to come easy .
The expenses for the use of such fuels would perhaps be as expensive if not more than the fossil fuels , not including the added expenses of manufacturing automobiles that can run on such fuels .
The viable solution to this would be , as I feel , is to rely on the public transport , as it would prove to be more economically viable .

The mode of transport for in the future as I see it is public transportation , which is not only fast but more economically and environmentally viable .

"Though I cannot conclusively state whether there will be fewer cars in use 20 years from now or not , I can assert with some degree of confidence that people will opt for various other modes of transportation in their everyday lives .

With the increase in the population and the average standard of living improving , we now see each family owning at least a car or two .
This puts a lot of pressure on the roads .
Traffic is usually a problem that one witnesses almost every day .
To get to a place where I could have otherwise , some 5 years ago , reached in 10 minutes , it now takes me close to an hour .
However , if the government does somehow manage to curb the aforementioned problems , then the situation could be different .

Also due to better and more convenient modes of public transportation - railway , metro , buses etc , .
The Government , having noticed the deteriorating conditions of traffic , has tried to do something to improve the congestion and road conditions leading to it .
But our nation has seen a population boom far beyond its expectations .
Roads cannot be broadened further and no more place for it can be alotted .
I have noticed a shift in peoples choice of everyday transportation .
Not only is it more convenient because it occludes problems of traffic , parking etc , but it also proves to be less expensive and more comfortable .

Admittedly , one cannot deny the advantages of having and using a car .
Some people are very passionate about cars , buying and using them .
Also , at times of emergency such as a late night need to go to the hospital or a doctor , or even for other conveniences , a car does come in handy .
Besides , certain people just hate public means of transportation .

To conclude , due to an increase in the number of cars attributable to a huge population boom , terrible road conditions and the improvement in public transportation , I do see a decline in the number of cars in use 20 years from now .

It has been employeed by people living in all sorts of geographic locations across the globe .
These mechanical wonders are known to be convenient , and are durable enough to sustain a life time of10 - 15 years at a bare minimum .
The skilled labour which is used for car maintenance is also present in abundance .

So far , no such alternative has come up which can actually substitute the cars .

Agreed there have been a few problems in terms of the pollution caused by the car engines which is leading to a sharp increase in global warming .
But this does n't really means we need to discard the cars altogether .
All that is needed is some form of modification in the type of engines employeed in the cars .
For instance , Gas engines could lead way to electic engines .
Also the recent developments in the discovey and application of Biodiesel could go a long way in ensuring that the cars are in use for the decades to come .
This sorts out the much hyped problem of diminshing fossil fuels which had been used so far for operating the cars .

Assuming that we do get a breakthrough technology today , which provides a more efficient and economically viable option to the cars , I seriously doubt whether that transition from cars to the newer option could be even half complete in a limited time span of 20 years .
There are a number of practical and financial aspects involved which would impede such transition at a rapid pace .
The powerful car manufacturers cant be expected to go out of business that soon .
They employ millions of skilled labour all over the world .
And for the benefit of the global economy , increased usage and number of cars is the required symptom .

Car manufacturing companies will try their level best to ensure that cars still remain a lucrative option for people by introducing modifiactions in the present cars from time to time .
The amount of money poured into researches in improving the car is likely to make the cars better , attractive and far more efficient .
The much awaited use of artificial intelligence interfaced with cars is already anticipated to create quite a stir .
These next generation cars can not be easily supplanted by any other form of transport , and if at all , then certainly not in next 20 years .

It would be safe to say that cars will continue to stay an integral part of our lives in the coming decades and continue to enchant us .

"Cars are one of the devices or tools that we use to commute from one place to another .
If we want to find out `` what will be the fate of cars in the next coming twenty years '' we have to cosider the technological , natural changes that can take place in this time period .

I agree with the prediction that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today by considering the technological revolutions or natural changes that have a great probablity to happen .

Technology is progressing day by day and we are getting a great invention of science in the period of two or three years .
Taking this fact into the account , we can think of the time when most of us will use aeroplanes or some other vehicles to travel from one place to other and fewer cars .

Our natural resources such as food and water , are becoming scarce because of their exploitation by human being and his intervention in the ecological system in a bad manner .
And the resources may reach upto the level when only few people will have access to these and people will not be able to afford expensive vehicles such as cars at that time due to limited money .
and This will result in decrement of people using cars .

Also in predicting the future of cars , we can not neglect the calamities and disasters that may happen in the time period specified .
For example , an earthquake that destroys the whole human civilization on earth comes and some of the people survive this disaster .
They have to restart the whole work from the scratch .
And , they may not be able to reproduce devices like cars to travel from one place to other or at that time it may not become cost effective to have more number of cars than there are today .

In summary , taking into account the great technological progress that is going on and the exploitation of natural resources by the human being at a fast pace , we can predict the future of the cars as being used in lesser numbers in the coming twenty years .

"I disagree with the opinion that number of cars in use after 20 years will be less than what it is today .
Instead I believe that the number of cars in use will rise and will be much more than what it is today .
I have number of reasons to support my opinion .

The world population is growing at a high rate .
Since population and number of vehicles bear a direct correclation , I expect that with more people , more cars will be bought and used .
It may be argued that more population does not automatically mean more buying power .
But it should be noted the countries with high population such as India and China are experiencing high economic growth rates .
This means that progressively , more and more proportion of population will have better buying power .
This in turn means that there would be a bigger and bigger segment that will be able to afford cars and therefore buy cars .

The cost of producing cars is also declining .
Again with cheaper cars , there will be more people who will be able to afford cars and therefore buy them .
Besides with research in identifying cheaper energy alternatives to petrol , the cost of running car is also expected to come down which will further encourage people to buy cars .

The government spending on developing road infrastructure will also promote the car sales .
Governments tend to spend lesser on public transport as compared to constructing highways .
This indirectly promotes car sales as limited and congested public transport drives people to buy their own vehicle .
Hence more cars will be used to avoid the inconvinience caused by public transport .

Also there are social reasons leading to disintegration of joint families into unitary families .
Besides the women that were previously more confined to home are joining the work force and moving out .
This means that while previously one family of say 10 people could do with one or two cars , now a family of 5 needs two cars .
The continued disintegration and women moving out of home will therefore fuel car sales even further .

Besides , as humans get wealthier , they look for more convenient options .
It cannot be denied that car provides the flexibility to take you right through to the destination as opposed to public transport such as train and trams where a person needs to walk to a stop or station , board the train or tram , then get down at destination station and again walk to his final destination .
With more wealth , people will definitely demand more convenience and hence shift to cars .

For all the reasons above , I strongly feel that there would be more and more cars with every passing day .
Cars are today most flexible and convenient way to travel .
For number of cars to go down , there has be a even more convenient alternative .
Since I do not see any such alternative in next 20 or even 50 years , I see more and more cars hitting the road .

"Fewer cars in twenty years ?
really sounds as if we are asked that will we have to leave our daily necessity ?
today cars have become a necessity of not only a rich person but also for the one who is just earning a hand full of money .
cars have really made are life comfortable and easy going ?
and we really ca n't think our life without them .
i dont think there will be fewer cars after twenty years .
today the man is progressing at such a fast pace that will only lead us to developing more and more cars with new technology .

The technology has made such an advancment that within months we have cars with a new and incredible functioning .
today we have automatic cars , with superb engine and their speed is somewhat we cant even think of driving at .
The new inventions being made on cars does not even limit us with the fuel that we utilize in driving the car .
today we have made cars that run even without fuel .

that either run on some gas or any other burning substance .
Further i believe making , buying and selling of cars is a bussiness that is really flourishing today .
we have so many racing cars these days that are so expensive and there is no shortage of costumers who buy these cars .
people invests a lot in car racing games that take place round the globe .
and after the race these cars are put to sale .

furtheron , i believe that today the economy is increasing at such a fast pace that there is no shortage of money , that people cannot buy a car .
even a normal financially stable familly today have two to three cars .
They are also a symbol of luxury for many people .
with the increasing population every second the demand and supply of cars are also increasing .

the new inventions and new facilities in a car like air condition , music system cars and big cars like limozine which are like a home in itself , are becoming more and more comfortable and easy going .
so i think that there will be more cars in twenty years than they are today .

"I absolutely agree with the above statement that there will be fewer cars in use in the future , than there are today .
The first and the foremost reason could be that the capacity of the roads had reached the threshold and the roads could not take in any more cars , thereby forcing the governments to provide more convenient , better , efficient and rapid public transport systems .
And once the pople have got used to this convenient mode of travelling , they do n't want to use their cars .

The second reason could be that , in future , the scarcity of oil will cause the fuel prices to inflate to such an extent , that it would become very costly for the people , especially the working class to use their cars on a solo basis .
Thus thay would be pooling their cars , there by reducing the number of cars plying on the road .

Thirdly , in future , the concept of ` Work from Home ' could be the default method used by the most of the bussineses , and this will definitely help reduce the number of cars on the road .
Also , many people will prefer working closer to home to avoid the rush-hour travelling .

Stricter government regulations for pollution and emissions may not permit all vehicles to run every hour or day .
It could be that vehicles of a particular type are allowed on a given day , while vehicles of another type are permitted on another hour or day .
Such restrictions may also discourage people from buying their cars , thus putting a check on the number of cars on the road .

Also the government may increase the taxes on cars to exhorbitant amount to discourage people from buying personal cars .
So , all these probable reasons can contribute to reduce the number of cars running on the roads in future .

"When we peek outside our houses the thing we can find in abundance outside our houses and on the roads is unrefutedly the Cars in different designs and colors .
The cars have changed the way we travel .
The invention of cars have brought a kind of a revolution in the times .
In addition to making the conveyance easier to saving time to accessing the remote areas cars have done almost everything to make our life more comfortable .
With the changing technologies and increasing economic growth i dont believe that the next twenty years in any way see a reduction in the cars .
This will be mainly because of the demand , advancement and status these four wheeled wonder is going to bring about .

With the increase in the pocket income and incentives more and more people will be able to buy the cars .
After all who wants to experience the overcrowding in the buses and trains and the waste of precious time these inconvenient travelling measures bring about .
The another factor which will increase the demand is the population growth .
With the population of the world sky rocketing the number of people who can avail the benefits of cars will increase and so do the cars .

Also with the advancement in the technology we will witness a whole new genre of cars in the next twenty years .
When people see something new and innovative they have a urge to buy it even though they may be having an absolete version of it .
So there may be many people with two or three cars in the next coming years .

Cars are frequently being associated with the social status of the people .
The people try to get everything that will elevate their status .
In many families we see peolpe having many cars .
One for going to office and other for social parties , other for children and hence enhancing their status with each car .
With these kind of social attitudes the sale of cars is definitely going to increase .

So we dont see any reason why the sales of cars will decline and we will see fewer number of cars in the years to come .
Though the excessive use of cars will create problems like traffic jams , chaos for parking , pollution and petroleum problems .
But these problems will find a suitable solution .
It just only needs cooperative effort and thinking .
So in the next twenty years we will witness more and also attractive cars down the road .

"I think that the over the time period the number of cars being used today will surely decline .
This is because of the increasing concerns over pollution , shrinking fossil fuel bases , availability of better ways to commute , cultural shift in dependency or association with cars and increased traffic .
All these factors are now evident to anyone who uses or sees cars everyday .

Pollution has emerged to be a major concern over the period of time , and now , in comparison to older times when cars were considered to be a symbol of freedom , people have started to see them as major causes of pollution .
Air pollution is done because of the usage of the common fuel , gasoline , even though we have modified the structure of gasoline to do less harm , e.g. high octane fuel , and have even equipped the cars with better technology , multiple stroke engines etc , still the safety limits are being pressed to edge , and we have experienced the damage .
e.g. depletion of protective ozone layer and increased respiratory diseases among urban population .

Next , the crude oil sources used to supply fuel for cars have been continously decreasing and have reached at such an alarming low level that scientist have cautioned to start looking for alternative fuels , which are either not that efficient or are not economically as viable as gasoline .

Also , over the period of time , people have deviced better ways to commute like bullet trains , people in Japan commute almost 500KM each day to work , which was not possible with cars .
Also , in other major cities alternatives means of transport such as metro rails and high capacity buses are experimented and are well recieved by people .

Moreover , these days we are moving away from the need that gave rise to this effective means of commutation such as going to work , companies are experimenting better ways like work from home options which do n't require employees to come to office , another example is reaching out to facilities such as convinient stores , now you can have everything delivered to your home on one phone call .
This will eventually wash away the need of cars .

Increased traffic and its effects like accidents are bothering people so much these days .
They are more concerened about the time lost in the traffic and their safety , after all who will want an everyday commutation to office or school to become an adventure ride .

So to summarize , with the increasing awareness and decrease in the causes that lead to the use of this means of transport , coupled with environmental and health factors the car will eventually become an old means of commutation .

Car , which was the travelling mode ( venegance ) for the privileged class in early 20th century , but with the growth of the technology now the cars is there in every house and in every streets .

The new technology makes the use of car more reliable and inexpensive .
After twenty years , the use of cars will definetely increase with the inovation of new new automobile technologies .
The use of solar car will replace the use of fuel feeding cars .
The modern technology made solar cars but still it is rare to find them in streets .
Because they are very expensive .
But after twenty years this expensive mode will also be available at reliable rates .

The constructions of fly overs , underground tunnels and the highways were help the people to go from one place to another with saving their time which otherwise they lost by hanging out in the heavy rush .
But how the people will travel from one place to another ?
They will prefer for self vehicles .
And if the solar cars which will be reliable to get then why the use of cars after twenty years will decrease ?

Every one wants to live a fast and speedy life .
Then why they will waste their time by depending on buses , trains .
They will try to have their own vehicle and the vehicle which is comfortable and inexpensive .
After twenty years the car rates will defenitely be reduced and every one will have their own car .

The problem after twenty years for using the cars will be of fuel , which is probably at the stage of extinction .
But technology is make the solution of this problem also .
The solar fuel , the energy trapped by solar module which stores the energy and transforms this energy to electrical energy .
So the use of solar cars will be both the solution for fossil fuel extinction as well as for pollution free fuel .
So in the next twenty years the people will make use of solar vehicles and if the solar cars will be available then why not solar cars , which is more reliable , inexpensive after twenty years , pollution free vehicle and free of petrol or any other fossil fuels .

In conclusion , it is quite definite that after twenty years the use of cars will increase only because of new techology like solar technology , automobile technology and also because of construction of big big flyovers , tunnels and highways .

"Cars in these days are seen as an almost indispensable part of life in alomost all the countries .
With the expansion of cities around the globe and with the dependance of life on comfort and luxury , the car production rates as well as their buying rates have increased .
And i think that this trend is going to continue .
So i disagree with the statement that in twenty years from now there will be fewer cars than today .

Next twenty years are destined to see a sudden and great increase in industrilization and a massive and rapid expansion of world in terms of population , income etc .
With a increase in net world income the standard of life of people is going to come up which in turn will help boost the car industry as people would rather prefer expending on car rather than having discomfort .

With the industrilization growth the availibility of time to perform a certain action or say for example delivery of goods from one place to another or for example reaching the office on time and in less time , is gonna decrease so the dependance of people on faster and more reliable of modes of transport ( within a city or country ) is going to increase which is again going to help give car industry a stimulus .

One more reason which can be cited in this regard is the people 's love for high speed and scientifically styled and desgned cars .
This trend will also see an upsurge in the next twenty years with more of the world population entering the youth age .
This trend will be most common in highly developed coutries where people will be able to afford and maintain these kind of cars .

Also in countries like US where the public mode of transport is not that common and where people prefer travelling by rather than by train or bus , with the increase in population the number of cars are going to increase .

Though one of the negative impact of an increase in the number of cars would be the effect on enviornment .
an increase in the number of cars would result in a more polluted enviornment which would further see a rise in enviornment related diseases such as asthma , cancer etc .
It is also probably going to create parking problems with the explosion of world population and the world space being limted and finite .
Another problem associated with an increase in the number or cars is the fuel shortage problem .
with the global oil crisis it has become constantly difficult to meet the increase in oil demands .

"The number of cars in use across the world has been growing steadily for the past fifty years , and one might naively expect that the number will keep increasing .
However , a more careful examination of the factors that affect the number of cars indicates that over the coming years , it is likely that the number of cars across the world will decline .
In particular , improved telecommunication , improved public transport facilities , rising fuel prices , and rising concern for pollution and congestion are likely to lead to a decline in car use .

Let us first examine some of the causes for the rapid growth in car use in recent times .
First , improved technology has resulted in reduced costs of car construction , and increased affluence of people has resulted in greater capacity to purchase cars .
Second , road networks have permeated cities and villages across the world , hence people are much more tempted to buy cars .
However , both these factors might be nearing their saturation point , now that road networks already very extensive and cars are within a range of affordability for many .

Another important factor in the growth of car use over the last fifty years is the increasingly hurried and rapid pace of life where people are expected to be available at any date , any place and any time .
People with the money have often preferred to buy their own cars rather than be at the mercy of erratic public transport .

However , the same hurried pace of life may now operate against cars .
With improved underground railway networks in major cities , and increased road congestion , many people have started prefering a train or bus commute to driving their own car through traffic .
In addition to public transport , many companies and organizations now run transport services for their own employees , which helps promote timeliness as well as discipline among employees .
Availing such transport facilities frees people of precious time and energy that would have gone into driving .

The teenage generation of today has seen the congestion of roads , pollution and rising fuel prices that have been brought about by an overuse of automobiles .
When these teenagers grow up and become the working class of society , they will thus keep in mind the adverse effects of car proliferation and many of them may refrain from getting or using their own vehicles .

Another important factor that will lead to a decline in car use is the rapid growth of telecommunication that will render a lot of transportation irrelevant .
Today , people can do a lot over email , telephone , instant messaging , and the Internet .
A person can shop while sitting at home , keep in touch with close relatives , and even participate in live discussions .
Thus , the need for instantaneous mobility will reduce significantly .

To summarize , I feel that car use is likely to decline over the coming years , both due to a recognition of the inherent problems with car proliferation and due to the emergence of viable alternatives for quick transportation and easy accessibility .

"I dont believe that in twenty years from now there will be less cars than there are today .
As we can see around us that it seems there is a deluge of cars and other modes of vehicles .
It seems that everybody wants to own a car as it has become a matter of status symbol and a nessecity .

As the world economy is getting stronger with each passing day and develping countries turning into developed ones , the financial capability of lay persons has improved a lot .
So they can spend on things of luxuries such as cars .
Another reason to believe that number of cars will only increase from here on and not decline is that today it is not difficult to obtain loans to buy a car , all the leading banks are willing to shell money out of there coffers to entice customers to get a car .

Although some people are driven by the thought that rising fuel prices and depleting fuel stocks will ultimately apply brakes on number of cars as people will not be able to buy fuel and in about next twenty years petroleum reserves will be exausted .
But I do n't think this will happen as scientists are working on prepring biofuel which will cost less and will last for greater time and I have a good example of this study as some of my friends prepared biofuel from Jatropha plant and with the help of this fuel they ran an engine .

With each passing day the prices of cars are slashed and new comforts are added so people think that they should go for it and own a car .
As in most of the countries the public transport system is very tiring and there is such a great rush of people that now people have started to use there own vehicle for commuting and this urge will lead to more cars .

You must have heard of `` biodiseal '' been used successfully in Brazil .
There are so many alternative fuels available these days .
Thanks to science !
What about Gasoline ?
It is widely used as an alternative fuel .
In India , New Delhi has shown dramatic results by using `` compressed gas '' ( popularly known as CNG ) .
It is known as clean fuel thus saving environment from pollution .
So , now what you say ?
Do we really have to stop buying cars ?
After twenty years , will there be any change in number of cars ?
In my opinion , Yes there will be change but a positive increase in number because now people are more educated .
They care for environment and thus fuel these days is used judiciously .
Scientists all over the world are experimenting in order to find oil from bacteria and plants .

`` Jatropha '' , a drought resistant plant has been a boon for dry countries as these plants can be grown in harsh climate areas also .
They are found to release oil which can be collected by harvesting the seeds of this plant and then sent to industries for purification processes .
So , there is no need to reduce the number of cars as so many clean fuels are available .
They are less toxic than fossil fuels .

This is because I believe that in twenty years from now , there will be an increase in the number of cars used as compared to what we see today .

The most important factor which supports my view is the kind of advancement in technology that we have .
I am sure that with developments in the above feild we will soon have better and improved versions of car models .
With the growing concern in terms of environmental pollution caused by cars , we will have better fuel saving , nature friendly models which will be welcomed by all .
Also it will attract more an more number of people to buy such eco friendly cars .

Another reason why I disagree with the statement is that , I feel cars are much more convinient than other public transport facilities available .
And therefore they serve as a better option for conveyance .
Hence , as man is more convinence oriented , in the future more and more people will be encouraged to buy cars .

Also , now a days people are becoming more and more aware of their status and respect in the society .
And in order to match up with the norms of the society dominated by rich people , they follow what others do .
So this attraction will to buy cars for themselves and therefore contribute to increase in the number .

Finally , i also believe that people are becoming richer day by day .
The class i am discussing is upper middlecalss an d the rich people .
Middle class and otherwise poor people can anyways not afford such a luxury .
So with more and more population having extra money will drive them into looking onto for previliges and luxury .
It is very much possible that different members of the same family will own different cars for their own convenience .

"I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from today .
The question at hand is highly controversial as many people believe otherwise due to various reasons such as increasing pollution and fuel costs .
However , I still believe that the number of cars on road will increase .

Going by statistics , there is no sign to show that car sales is decreasing .
Every year , more and more number of cars are being sold across the globe .
The rapid rise of several coountries such as India and China will only increase the car markets for the manufacturer , leading to higher production .
Thus , there is no indication whatsoever to believe that the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years .

Also , due to the generally risng standards of people , and the car manufacturers desiging and manufacturing cheaper and more efficient cars give rise to the speculation that as more and more people are able to aford a car , they will go ahead and purchase one .
One another major reason for this the rapid increase in the number of roadways avaliable in the world .
More and more number of countries have now started building broader and smoother highways .
Thus , improved infrastucture is not only an indicator of the trend that more people are going to invest in cars , it is also an incentive .

Many people might feel that due to the increasing awareness about the negetive effect of cars on air pollution and the rising oil prices , the number of cars may decrease in the coming years .
However , most of the companies have already taken a note of these factors , and working their way around these problems rapidly .

Hybrid cars had already hit the road a long time back .
Cars are also being developed which run on alternative fuels , such as edible oil and CNG ( Compressed Natural Gas ) .
These new innovations will make sure that the enviornmental pollution is kept under check and at the same time , the cars become less dependent on oil .

"Although the stated statement looks unbelievable , but I agree to the point mentioned and is based on following :

First , almost governments of all countries are concentrating on improvement and betterment of public mode of transport .
I believe this will have an sound effect on the number of cars getting diminished .
The public mode of transport being cheaper and safer than cars would provide better option and convenient journey to common man in contrast to the situation now .

Second , the ever growing fuel prices will force common man to rethink on using personal cars for day to day use .
The fuel prices have been sky rocketting and according to the study this pattern would continue for years to come .
Some may cast doubt on this study by arguing that fewer cars would automatically bring down the demand for fuel and hence price .
As a matter of fact , cars are not the only demander of fuel .
Fuel is used in various industries , airplanes , ships , busses etc .

Third , the very fact that global economy is doing well is a factor responsible for number of cars present .
Economy doing well increases the purchasing power of the common man .
But this fairy tale might not continue for long .
Again going by history patern and economic gurus , a slowdown or correction in economy is due and expected to continue for atleast 10 years .
This slowdown will automatically bring down the purchasing power of common man as well as the loan providing facilities by financial institutions which has assisted people to buy cars on a rampage .
The rate of interest will go higher which will not allow common man to even think of going for the loan .

Finally , when we talk of economic slowdown , the prices of some essential commodities will surge like that of steel .
We all know that steel is major raw material in car manufacturing .
Now if the raw material cost goes up , it will automatically augment the input cost .
Hence to increase bottomline on balance sheets , car manufacturers will increase the car prices which will drill holes in common man 's pocket .
This can be exemplified by recent spur in prices of cars by GM .

"I disagree with the statement because man has always been on the for methods to make his life more convinient , and as far as getting from one palce to another on a daily basis is concerned , four-wheelers are what make his life comfortable and so he has no qualms in procuring a car if he can afford one .

In twenty years from now , it is unlikely that population of the world would decrease or even remain fairly constant , and with more and more automobile firms introducing cost-effective cars it is safe to assume that in the future more and more people will be able to afford cars and hence the number of cars on the roads will increase .

Another major factor to support my claim is the fact that no concrete laws exist keep in check the number of vehicles in a particular region .
This allows people , especially families , to purchase as many number of cars they want as per their requirement .

Also the fact that people now consider two wheelers to be dangerous to ride also lends support to my stand .
people now are well informed of the increasing number of two wheeler accidents which can be attributed to their relative instability and insecurity ac compared to cars .
they feel reluctant to use a two wheeler when they have the option of using a car and hence as time progesses it is safe to say that this preferance will indeed cause an increase in the number of cars in the coming years .

Technological advancements in the automobile industry will also allow people to use `` non-polluting '' vehicles in the future .
with the increasing number of pollution norms such cheap and `` clean '' vehicles will provide an escape route for the world 's population whose rising numbers will obviously lead to the popularity and widespread use of such vehicles in comparision to today i hope that with the arguments stated above , it would be easy to forsee the increasing number of cars in the years to come .

"What is going to happen twenty years later , cannot be predicted accurately by anyone .
The use of cars will decline or increase depends a lot on the success of the contemporay researchers success , who are curently working diligently on finding an alternate renewable and cheap source of energy , which may help power the engines of the future automobiles .

If we do not find a replacement for gasoline as a fuel for driving the cars engines , this exhaustable fuel source will some day deplete .
In the situation of reducing supply of the fuel for the car , the prices of the oil will increase , making it less afordable .
The car companies may initially decrease the prices of their automobiles to lure the customers harrowed by the increasing oil prices .
This price decrease may not last long , since the car companies will realise later that it is more sensible to sell high priced cars to a few people and gain a higher profit by working less , rather than making more cars to gain the same or may be even lower profits .
Hence the number of cars on road may decrease .

Furthermore as the world economies grow more , the governments of the world would try to improve the public transport systems , and recomend to their citizens to favour it over the use of private vehichles .
The litreacy rate is also bound to increase with time .
Hence the literate and more sensible citizens would readily take the advise of the governments and start favouring public transport .
This would again decrease the number of cars .

If a new renewable and cheap fuel source is invented , initially the automobile industry may suffer due to the technological changes that it may have to adopt but , eventually this may bring about a boom in the automobile industry .
People would be interested in trying the new technology , and hence try to adopt it .
Cheap and non poluting fuel may make people want to own their own private vehicles .
The government will try to subsidise this new fuel to wean off its citizens from the use of gasoline .
Such moves will make people want more cars and hence the numbers of the cars on road may increase .
The growing population of the world is producing more consumers , hence the number of cars in the given circumstances are bound to increase .

Hence in conclusion I would like to say that the question of weather of not the number of cars in the future is goin to decline cannot be answered instantly .
It depends on the developments in science in the near future .

"Over the years , use of cars has increased to an enormous extent .
It is really not difficult to find roads jam packed with cars .
It would be interesting to predict the usage of cars in future when the number of people requiring them would have increased tremendously .
In my opinion , the number should definitely go up .

Twenty years from now , world population would have increased by atleast 15-20 percent of what it is today .
The number of car users would also increase accordingly .
It would thus be expected that the number of cars also increase proportionately .
However , there might be certain counter arguments challenging this simple hypothesis .

One would suggest that the advancement in aviation in coming future would promote use of air transport at the day to day level and would be used for moving around even for very short distances .
This would tend to decrease the usage of cars to a great extent as a lot of space ( in terms of volume ) is really unexploited in this regard .
I believe that the advancement in aviation would not counter the difficulties in air traffic management that would eventually come up and so , air vehicles as move around mode of transport , are far fetched for twenty years from now .
However , this might be a healthier argument for say fifty years in future when systems for air traffic management could be devised .

Another contradictory opinion would be forced decrease in car usage as the traffic and capacity to accomodate cars is nearing its threshold world over .
I feel that ways would be devised to counteract this problem and some of them could be flooding cities with flyovers and subways ( city administrations ' initiative ) or making smaller and more compact cars ( car manufacturers ' initiative ) .

Another line of thought would be to suggest decrease in car usage as a consequence of increasing pollution level .
This can be either forced by laws or as an outcome of conscious awareness of the problem among the users themselves .
I feel that technological advancements would make it possible to have cars operated by energy sources other than the conventional petroleum products , e.g. , cars operated by solar batteries , wind energies and so on some of which are currently at the experiemental level .

Thus , it seems highly probably that twenty years down the line , number of cars used would be even greater than what they are today .
",P5,HIN,high,0
"I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Firstly , the fuel reserves on this planet are limited and the consumption of fuel is only increasing with time .
One of the reasons for the increase in fuel consumption , mainly petroleum , which is easier and cheaper to refine , is the growing population worldwide .
Petrol is not only needed to run cars but also needed to run cities - to generate electricity which is needed to run all our electrical appliances at home .
Also with an increase in air travel , the fuel consumption has gone up .
Another reason for increase in fuel consumption is due to the increase in industrialization and other technological advances and research .
Thus although the fuel consumption is increasing , the resources are limited and hence the demand will eventually outdo the supply .
Thus to prevent this the number of cars running on the roads will need to be reduced .

Although , alternative resources of fuel which are more enviornment friendly are being researched , such as substituting petroleum with ethanol , which is being widely discussed about currently , the researchers have a long way to go before this can be used commonly by the consumer .
Various other factors such as fuel economy and effects of using this alternative on the car engine need to be sorted out .
I also feel that the costs of substituting petroleum with other fuel alternatives would be very high and not possible for the common man to sustain fuel charges for his car from econimics point of view .
Hence not many will be able to afford cars then automatically causing a deline in the number of cars .

Lastly , we all know that the current increase in the number of vehicles on the road in addition to the increase in fuel consumption is causing a lot of enviornmental changes .
Global warming is only increasing by the day .
Even scientists are shocked with the effects of pollutants released in the air on our climate .
These drastic changes in our climate will compel us to decrease the use of cars and look for more enviornment friendly alternatives .
",P5,HIN,high,0
"I agree with the view that in future there will be fewer cars than there are now .
On the one hand , the cars are one of the most convenient mode of transportation and also the most popular one .
On the other hand , the factors such as growth in population , scarcity of land and concentration of population in the urban centers indicates towards a future situation where we might actually see a reduction of cars in future .
In the final analysis , there are more and stronger indications for decrease in the number of cars in future .

First , due to the rising population and overcrowding in the cities , it has become extremely difficult to travel in cars as there are frequent traffic jams and lack of parking space .
The other modes of transportation such as buses and trains are more convenient and faster .
Further , since most of the cars are owned by people in cities the number of cars will decerases due to the above factors in the coming times .

Second , the problem of pollution and overcrowding in the cities due to the increase in the number of cars have forced governments in countries like Singapore impose high taxes on purchase of vehicles .
They have also imposed toll charges for entering in the main city areas .
Thus , the government regulations can also discourage people from purchasing more cars and this will contribute to an overall reduction of cars in future .

Third , the probelm of the scarcity of non-renewable fuels is pushing up the fuel prices everyday , making it more and more difficult to travel in cars .
It has already led to the increase in popularity of the cheaper public transportation , this has been the case with trains in Mumbai ( India ) , where many people who used to travel in cars have shifted to travelling in trains and for these people new air conditioned trains have also been started .

Finally , the development of the alternative means of transportations like improved buse service , better network of trains , etc can again lead to a reduction in the number of cars purchased by people and contribute to a reduction of the total number of cars in times to come .

Thus , for the reasons given above I believe that in future cars will be fewer in number than they are now .

"I disagree with the given statement that in the coming twenty years the number of cars on road will actually decrease .
Many people may believe and support this because of the fact that petroluem resources are depleting and the sudden rise in prices of petrol and diesel have supported their point of view .

But what they actually fail to see is the facts .
As of today we have not even discovered ( leave alone taking out ) 50 % of the petroluem resources present on earth .
The theory or curve used for energy consumption is Logistic curve .
This curve shows that energy consumption reaches to a maximum value at exactly the mid point of the life span of the resource .
Till today we have not reached that mid point even .

Another point is that , the rate at which the automobile sector is growing today it is impossible to say that in the next twenty years it will be gone .
All the big industries can not be closed in just twenty years .

Coming back to the petroluem , it is true that the cost of oil will continue to increase and slowly it will not be affordable for the commom man to use it for transportation but other alternatives are coming up slowly .
They include Bio-fuel , coal gasification and coal liquification , etc ..

I have myself worked on Bio-fuels ( specifically bio-diesel ) .
In my project I used bio-diesel as fuel for a diesel engine and compared engine performance and emission characterstics with diesel on other hand as fuel .
The conclusion was that bio-diesel produces less pollutants and is cheaper as compared to diesel prices as of today .
Moreover it is bio-degredable .
The researchers are having lot of hopes with bio-fuels because of above mentioned advantages .
In my country government has taken several initiatives for mass-production of bio-diesel .

There are other alernatives for petroluem also .
eg. For the short term requirement of petrol/diesel and gas , coal liquification and coal gasification are best possible answers .
In these processes solid coal is converted to natural gas and liquid petrol .
As there is no scarcity or crisis for coal today , this will be a possible answer for some years .

Also much research is going on on electric cars .
Indian company REVA is producing an electric car called REVA II which is available for consumers .

Hence in all it is evident that the number of cars on road will only increase but the rate of increase may drop down .
And the problem of energy crisis will be solved because human civilization will survive as it has till date and whenever such problems come , alternatives have been found out and implemented .

"The important issue under consideration is the use of cars in future say twenty years from now .
I would like to agree with the statement that there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .
It may seem a little surprising but there are numerous advances and happenigns which support this view .

One of the important reasons for the reduction in number of cars in near future is goign to be the oil .
Judging by the recent trends in oil prices it would be almost impossible for common person to own a personal car .
There is a goign concern about the limited petroleum reserves on which presently our automobiles run .
The suggested replacements like solar cars electric cars are n't a very viable option right now .
Going by the trend it would take them few decades to mature into consumer products which afford the same flexibility .

Secondly beside the fact about the fuel shortages there is a growing concern for the harmful effects of the emmissions on the enivironment .
This has led to planning of better public transport system and novel ways like car pools to reduce the emissions and use the resources efficiently by bundling together people goign to similar places at the same time .
Hopefully newer ideas like shuttles bullet trains ertc might help to cater to the transport needs of the increase in population .
Such awareness would reduce the number of cars on road .
Maybe we might get the technology to teleport liek star trek in few decades just a whimisical thinking .

Thirdly there is a major problem of congestion .
The public roadways in most places is n't geared to handle such huge traffics and the government does n't have fuinds to improve them further .
There has been an increase of over 300 % in the number of cars in my city New Delhi only .
This translates into more jams and delays in the work schedules .
There is also a growing problem of parking space .
The metropolitians are already too crowded to afford a parkign space prsently itself .
An average oiffcie goer in cannaught Place new Delhi has to park his car on an average two kilometers away .
The situation in future is n't goign to provide incentive to the people to buy new cars .
This is further aggravated by the number of accidents .
A recent study conducted by the Delhi Transport Authority shows a disturbing trend of increase in number of accidents over the period of ten years .
This translates directly into loss of life and property .
hence it is expected that in future the number of cars would actually go down .

But finally and most importantly with the advent of internet it might actually be possible that people do n't need to travel out that often .
We might just do our shopping over ebay or order deliveries from our home .
The facilities of teleconferencing and videoconferencing might go a long way and remove the use of actual transport of oneself physically oevr to the other palce .
we already have succesful examples of oursourcing .
These may be further modeled into working from home .
Schooling can be done oevr internet .
Children migth get lectures and assignments sittign at home .
They can reference huge databases for their assignments .
We can for example get our compete bank accounts over net in case of ICICI .
We can but airline tickets or stuff using our VISA credit card .
This would reduce the need of edxtra trips to work place shopping malls and schools .
This would translate into lesser use of private owned car thus the futility of owning one .

The idea of lesser cars in next twenty years is based on the fatc that we humans would like to make this environment better and make the best use of the technologicval advances thereby reducing the number of cars on the road .

"I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While guided tours have their advantages, independent travel offers more freedom, flexibility, and authenticity.

Traveling in a group with a tour guide can limit your experiences and interactions with locals. When you are part of a guided tour, you often follow a set itinerary, visit crowded tourist spots, and have limited time for personal exploration. In contrast, independent travel allows you to create your own itinerary, discover hidden gems, and engage with the local culture on a deeper level.

Furthermore, traveling independently allows you to tailor your trip to your interests and preferences. You can choose where to go, how long to stay, and what activities to engage in based on your own desires. This level of customization is often not possible on a guided tour where the group's needs and preferences take precedence.

Lastly, independent travel fosters personal growth and self-reliance. Navigating a new destination on your own forces you to problem-solve, adapt to unexpected situations, and step out of your comfort zone. These experiences can lead to greater self-confidence and a deeper sense of independence.

"I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Travel to an unknown destination can be challenging and maybe even intimidating to some .
But I personally believe that exploring and discovering the unknown is the real thrill in travel .

A tour guide would take his group to all the popular tourist destinations , following a set schedule and give them a brief history of each place .
When you travel on your own , you are on your own schedule .
People are most likely to travel when on vacation , and you certainly do n't need to abide by a schedule when on vacation and away from work .
When you are travellling on your own , you can get a map , scout places , get recommendations from locals and visit all the places that seem intruiging and appealing to you .
You can read up and learn about the history in ways that you would like and not have some guide rattle it out to you .
If safety is of concern , you could always travel with a group of friends and still set your own pace .
Memories of places visited would have more excitement , as it would not be just the history of the place that you would take with you but also all your efforts in getting to the place and other such experiences .
On your own , it is more likely that you would visit a place that is not a common tourist destination but one that definitely meets your tastes and expectations .
When travelling or visitng New York , a tour guide would definitely take you to see the Empire State Buidling , Times Square and the Statue of Liberty but for a complete expereince of a New Yorker , you would need a lot more than that .

To summarize , I would like to say that travel on your own is definitely more rewarding than travelling in a group with a tour guide .

"People travel to all over the world for various reasons .
Some do it because they want a change in their lives , whereas others do it beacause they want to explore the world and want to know about that place , the people and their culture .

Hence , I feel that if the reason is to explore the world or the place , the best thing is to do in a group led by a tour guide .
A tour guide is a person who is professionally qualified to help and show people the places they are travelling to , so it would be really easy if you are with a tour guide .
Also , travelling in a group has its own charm .
You are not only enjoinyg a new place but also you are sharing your experience and your joy with others too .

Although , I do agree if we are travelling in groups we dont possess the amount of freedom we would enjoy when we are alone but being in groups with a tour guide is beneficial in many other ways .
Firstly , since he is an expert you will get to explore and see all important places which you might miss if you are travelling alone .
For example you might just miss amonument and you later regret that you might have consulted a tour guide .
Also , by chance if you face any kind of problems you have so many people helping you out .
For example , you might have a problem with your health in a place which is new to you .
It might be great cause of concern , whereas if you are travelling in a group you have so many people to count on .

Also , there are people in this world who do not have families or friends these kind of groups are really beneficial for them .
It has been seen that after spending days together you really beacame friends even after you finish off with your trip .

When people travel in groups they spend all extra time singing , enjoing , dancing with each other .

3. It is safer
4. We may get discounted tickets for tourist attractions .
Let me elaborate on these points .
Since , the tour guide is well familiar with the tourist destination , he can make a detailed schedule of our day to day activities .
Also , he will manage our time in such a way that we are able to visit all the important points of attractions .
And because he will be involved in planning and driving we can spend more time relaxing and enjoying .
This is specially important for couples , as they will get more quality time to spend with each other .
On the contrary , if you travel alone or in a small group without a travel guide , you are responsible for managing all aspects of the trip .
This may lead to inefficient planning and waste of time .

It is also safe to travel in a group and with a person who is aware of good and bad neighborhoods .
One of my friends once went to a foreign country for vacation .
He did not arrange for a tour guide .
Unfortunately , he was mugged the very first day of his trip and was stabbed in the stomach too .
Thus , ruining his vacation plans completely .

Additionally , most of the tour guides have contacts with local merchants and attraction managements .
Hence he may be able to arrange for discounted food and entertainment tickets .
Who does n't like to save some extra money ?

Finally , I would like to repeat that I strongly suggest travelling in a group led by a tour guide .

"In my opinion , the appropriatness of traveling in a group led by a tour guide depends on the nature of the person and the place to be travelled .
For an enthusiast like me , the schedule of a group travel will be very binding and I wo n't be able to enjoy as much .
But for elderly people and people with kids , it will be more enjoyble if everything is taken care of by a tour guide .

But in some circumstances , tour group becomes very essential .
For example , if I am travelling in a foreign country and I do n't know their language , I will prefer travelling in a tour group .
By doing that , I will save the pain of ordering wrong things on the menu , and more importantly , I wo n't keep loosing my way because of sign boards written in a foreign language .

Also , if I am travelling to a place of historical importance , I would like to be led by a tour guide who can give me more information about that place .
In situations , when I have very little time on hand and there are lots of places to see , I think I will be better off as a part of a tour group .
Or else , I 'll waste most of my time , finding and reaching all the tourist spots on my own .

On the other hand , if I am going on an adventure trip for camping and trekking , tour groups will be the last thing on my mind .
Also , If I am on a spiritual or relaxing trip , to a calm place with not many things to explore , the tour group will not be very useful .

I feel tour groups led by tour guides are important , but it depends on travellers discreation to decide if it is the best way to travel .
As a conclusion , I would like to state that I do not agree with the given statement .

"Travel in a group with a tour guide is gaining poularity nowadays and some people do consider it the best way to travel .
However , it is not for me .
I am a person who believes in self-discovery and I like discovering places on my own and at my own pace .

For me , travel is a discovery and making friends with local people , getting to know them and living their culture is the true experience of travel .
I believe in taking out time to understance the cultural nuances of the new place and attempt to comprehend the true culture of every new city that I visit .

I have heard quite a few stories from people who had a fantastic time in group travel with tour guides .
I myself have sent my parents to such trips when they come to visit me as they are old and having a tour guide is the easiest way for them to have a comfortable , safe trip in a foreign land .
But , for me , with age on my side right now I do n't feel the need for a guide .
I believe that when you travel to someplace new you should be in that mood - willing to explore , try new things and meet new people .
Traveling on your own gives you the opportunity to converse with the local people and the `` authentic '' stories that you hear from them are incomparable to the pre-planned , oft-repeated stale information from a guide .

So far my experience with a group led by a tour guide has been fairly limited .
It was only on one occasion that I opted for such an arrangement and that was on my trip to Kerala in India .
The group was well organized , our itinerary fixed and lots of places planned for in the short trip .
I do n't think I got the real flavor of the state as the pace was too fast for me to understand the diversity and the traditional values the country is so famous for .

There are benefits of a group-travel .
But , personally I am all for travelling on my own .
I like to set the pace of my trip , relax on some days and explore a lot on some other days and most importantly , get the true flavor of the country and not just visit the so-called `` points '' of tourist-attraction that group travel arrangements usually entail .

"Most people travel to different destinations and visit historically significant monuments to know more about them .
It expands the span of their knowledge about the culture and special features of the kind of people inhabiting that area .
So I would prefer travelling in a group which is headed by an able-headed and knowledgeable tour guide .
For me it would be more explorative , interesting and a good worth for the money I spend .

Traveling in a group with a guide makes one explore an area extensively .
Like a couple of days back I went for a day trip to the grand canyons in arizona .
We had a a guide who made our trip an outing to remember .
Since he was a native of the region for the past thirty years he told us about all the interesting houses of golf players and movie stars on our way .
He gave a little background information about what we were likely to see on our way in his own happy - go - merry way with a small anecdote which made it all the more interesting .
I was initially skeptic of embarking the trip due to the number of hours spent in the bus but the five hour journey just flew away and seemed like an hour or so .

We all want that the travel guide we choose should be able to provide enough information so that we get our money 's worth .
I also think that with a guide I might not feel insecure and worried about losing my way or wasting my time looking at inappropriate sites or even .
It will make me feel more relaxed and will fulfil my purpose of embarking the trip even more which always is to invigorate my mind and elevate my spirit .

As far as it is good to have a travel guide , at times it becomes messy and irritating having somebody following you around especially if you head out on a day when your stars are bad .
Guides can even be quite interfering , poking their noses unecessarily in other people 's affairs , or one might feel restricted to his whims and fancies .
At times they may even get on your nerves .

But in my opinion your trip proves to be more fruitful when you travel with a guide to lead your way .
It will aid in gaining a lot more information about a place and one would feel that they have spent their time and money in a purposeful manner .

"I dis-agree to the statement `` The Best way to travel is in a group led by a Tour Guide ''

I believe that when one travels , one needs to explore the place to the fullest .
Travelling is a passion which teaches you to explore , learn and experience .
Although i agree to the fact that Tour Guide have a first hand experience about the places and they have been time and again experiencing the place , i believe they are doing their Job .

But the actual thrill which i believe about travelling is the experience of finding it urself .
When with a tour guide , one does not necessarly make an effort to find about the details of a place or the zest of it .
One just goes by the tour guide and assumes that he has covered everything .
Tour guide is like a book , i agree , who opens out the entire picture to the travellers whom he is guiding , but the benifits of a research which one gets by meeting the local people , their food , culture and place and the rest through books or guides is phenominal .

The tours led by guides ristricts the intensities of exploring a place .
One has to go with the pace of the rest of the group led by the guide .
This prohibits not only the learning or exploring pace but also the freedom of other decisions you want to take during the travelling experience .

I as a person love to meet people , learn culture and customs of others by being around them and by interacting with them .
For that reason , i totally would like to be on my own or in a comfortable group who has similar thinking and love travelling .

I believe that when one is spoon fed , one does not make an effort to learn beyond the paradigm .
Similarly when one intends to explore a place and its people , a group led by a tour guide does not do justice to the place .
The hidden facts that the tour guide conveys can also be inferred from a book or a tour guide .

Travelling is a form of freedom in my eyes , and i believe the best result and the knowlege of a place is when one makes an adventourous effort to explore it .
",P6,HIN,high,0
"The topic of discussion today is whether it is good to travel in a group led by tour guide .
I believe that travelling in a group accompanied by a tour guide is a better option for several reasons .

Travelling in a group with guide enables us to visit all the places of importance which we may otherwise miss .
It gives us the opportunity to know about the place we are visiting in a better way than what we can do on our own .

Secondly historical places have certain history associated with them which we would never come to know if we do not have a travel guide .
Someone with appropriate knowledge can only guide us about the stories behind various momuments .

Suppose if we go visit Taj Mahal in India without a guide we would just be able to see a building and would not know what it specifies on the other hand if we are accompanied by a guide he would tell us the story behind the Taj Mahal which would make it more interesting and attractive .

Moreover travelling in group makes us enjoy more than what we can do alone and have better memories associated with certain events happened during the trip .
We can have more people to share with what we are feeling and enjoy with .

Additionally travelling in group proves to be more cost efficient than travelling alone as the expenses are shared amongst the group and one individual is not overburdened with all the expenses .

So we can conclude that travelling in group led by the Tour guide is the better option for visiting places as it turns out to be more opportunistic and cost efficient morever we enjoy more when in group rather than alone .

"I totally concur to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group and led by a tour guide .
A tour guide well acquinted with the places of visit and is very beneficial when its a place having historic importance .

We had visited the Vatican City during this summer .
Even after doing a entensive course work before going to the trip it was unavoidable from hiring a tour guide .
Gaining knowledge from books is always considered less than gaining knowledge from experience .
It was easier for us to locate the places but we were literally confused when it came to the historic significance of the place .
Eventually , we landed up in hiring a tour guide which made our visit more pleasureable and even revealed a lot of unknown facts about the Vatican City which we might not have known .
The tour guide showed us each and every artifact of historic significance and also gave a brief description of the rituals carried out in the city .
Our trip was a success and even today it feels us with joy when we think about the Vatican City trip .

Travelling in a group has its own charm and benefits in comparision to travelling alone .
The most important and noticeable fact of travelling in a group is that we never get bored and the trip become more enjoyeable when the group consists of friends .
As mentioned in the previous paragraph , we had been to Vatican City during the summer .
Our group consisted of 5 members including me .
We had distributed the task among ourselves which was quite helpful in planning the trip .
I had the task of studying the maps and marking the places of interest on it whereas my other friends had various other tasks .
The planning of the trip was so perfect that we saw each and every place on the map and were never late of any event .
It would have been difficult for a single person to perform such a full proof planning .
And even the expenses of the trip is also reduced considerable as the overall expenses are distributed among the group .

The next time i plan a trip i would definitely plan it along with my friends and will always hire a tour guide .

"` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' ...
I would certainly agree with the statement .
Travelling is a lot of fun and also a good learning experience .
If one wants to enjoy as well as learn the abouth the history , culture and habitat of the place a tour guide would certainly be helpful .
Educating oneself about the place prior to visiting it by books and the internet is very helpful too but having a guide who is local and has the knowledge is definately better .

I feel that in a group with a guide one can have a planned itineary and can organize the trip in a better fashion .
If i would be by myself i probably would get lazy most mornings and waste time getting around .
By being in a group i would probably use my time and money in a more efficient way .
For me even while Im travelling going by a schedule really helps .
Being by oneself I feel one wastes lot of time first collecting the information and then deciding where and when to go .
With a tour guide one is in better hands to travel and sight see comparing to ones own .
By having a tour guide one can learn more .
I feel that I remember more after seeing a thing / place and listening about it rather than just reading about it .
A local guide might have some stories to tell about the place which one may not find in any of the books .

Personally for me a group of people is more fun to go out with .
I strongly agree with the statement - ` more the merrier ' .
Travelling , singing , dancing and eating out could be more fun for me with more people around rather than being by myself .
Going to a new place might be intimidating at first but being in a group would just make me feel at home all the time .
I love making new friends and going out in a group also helps cultivating new relationships and friends .

Hence I would strongly recommend anyone to travel in a group rather than being on ones own .

"I certainly agree that travelling in a group with a tour guide is the best option .
Travelling outside of the place where you live is one of the most exiting and enjoyable things to do in most peoples lives .
People tend to take vacations to get away from the rigours of daily life .
Most people would certainly like to go alone or with an individual family if the choice existed .
However most places that people consider are far away and exotic in nature , not to ignore the fact that they could be dangerous too .
Take for example the Bali in Indonesia .
The recent terrorist strike in Bali killed a lot of people , mostly vacationeers .

Going in a group offers a lot of benifits to a traveller .
Most airlines and hotels offer group booking discounts as well as preferential service .
Travelling in a group also makes you feel secure rather than travelling alone .
Travelling in groups would be specially advantageous to people with kids as I believe kids are better behaved and more entertained when they are in a group .
Going in a group with a tour guide would also help people with disabilities .
Also , why do something when you can have someone do it for you ?
This is the type of question most people would ask when going out on a trip .
Instead of spending time and researching about a particular destination , it would be better to employ a local expert ( tour guide ) to guide you to the right places and explain the history and culture of that particular place .
A tour guide would also be helpful incase there is an emergency and you might need to contact the local authorities or need any kind of help .
Also with their experience most tour guides are able to guide us to the right spots and destinations , making the most of our vacation .

"It is definitely important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts because facts are based on ideas and concepts .
There always is some concept in the process to reach for a particular fact .
So if a student is not clear in his/her ideas or concepts he will definitely have some problem in finding a particular fact about something .

Let us take an example .
Suppose that there is a student working on some physics paper .
Now he comes across a point of `` WORK '' . and he notices that the formula for force is WORK = FORCE * DISPLACEMENT ( force multiplied by displacement )
Now if the student does not know anything about `` displacement '' , i.e. whether a positive or a negative displacement , he will be confused .
Another important thing is that the `` facts and figures '' , that we make use of while understanding the `` idea or concept '' , are also based on some concepts .
Working on a concept with some facts leads to a new `` fact '' .

We sometimes take an example of Newtons third Law of Motion in our everyday life .
The law states that `` Every action has an equal and opposite reaction '' .
Suppose we hit the wall with our hand , it definitely hurts .
The reason for this is that when we apply force on a body it reacts to it at the same moment the force is applied .
We never wonder why we are hurt .
This also has many reasons .
First of ll the third law of motion prompts the wall to react back .
Secondly the density of the wall is more than our hand .
Because if we hit a bag of cotton with the same force it wont hurt Here we have made use of facts and concepts both .
We see that `` facts '' and `` concepts '' are interrelated but it is very important to understand the concepts and ideas before we try to learn or arrive at any fact .
Moreover if we dont understand any ideas or concept we just keep on working on the known facts .
But if we concentrate on the concepts or ideas about a particular thing , it may be that we develop a new fact about it .
",P7,HIN,high,0
"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn them .
When a student is taught ideas and concepts it helps him develop his own understanding and gives him the power to analyse differences in two given situations .
A student who has learnt the concepts properly can apply these and thus come out with a solution on his own .
So what this does is , it promotes and drives the student to grow as an individual intellectually .

Now consider the case that the student is given all the facts .
He will have all the knowledge that he needs to solve a particular problem or he will have all the answers to any question that is thrown at him .
Since he has learnt these facts , its easier for him to recall them whenever he needs to .

This is where the comparasion of the two practices is required to ultimately determine which is more desirable or which one is more beneficial to the student .
While knowing all the facts can be considered an asset , not knowing how and where to use them to achieve the desired goal , means that all the factual knowledge is wasted .
In such cases the understanding of ideas and concepts is more beneficial as the student will know how to use the information he has or can comprehend from a given situation or example and still come up with a solution .

For example i am taught in a phychology class that an individual when scared , acts in a particular way , i will learn that as a fact and the way i need to respond to that will also be learnt .
Now suppose the person for some reason , choses to act differently and takes me by surprise , since a response for this has not been learnt .
So every fact is not useful , the understanding of the concepts of behaviour in this kind of a situation is more advantageous and can help effectively deal with such a situation .

So i feel it is more important for a student to understand rather than learn everything he can because things learnt may be forgotten but if the student still has his concepts right , he can still deal with anything .

"Knowing ideas and concepts form techniques to understand a subject or topic .
Facts are true statements about the subject or topic .
When it comes to deciding which of these are better for indepth knowledge of a subject or topic , then I completely agree with the statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
My opinion is influenced by certain factors which include ; need to analyse a topic to learn better , better rememberance of facts and having a grip on the topic so that new facts can be easily understood .

When we think of learning , the first thing that comes to mind is how to understand the contents .
To understand the subject , we need to analyse its contents .
For example , we are dealing with a fact that all matter is made up of atoms .
Its very simple statement , but we must understand why it is so to appreciate the fact stated .
Here comes the requirement for analysis .
As we analyse the topic , we could also understand the need for stating this , which could be that we are studying the structure of some material say benzene .

Next we need to remember some facts of a subject .
The example quoted earlier was a simple logical fact .
But , some complex facts like the Einstein 's theory of relativity is not very easy to remember .
It needs understanding of the content to memorize the fact .
Without a proper understanding of the concepts involved which made the scientist to propose the theory , it is just impossible to remember the fact propose as it is very complex .

Lastly , when we are learning something , it should not be mere memorizing of the facts stated , but , it should be a concrete base for furthur developmental study .
In simpler words , learning something should be like a foundation to a building .
The building could be a research or knowing newer facts to be understood .
Suppose , while experimenting , we make an observation , then without a understanding the idea of conducting the experiment and concepts included in the processes involved in it , we will not be able to conclude from the experiment .
So , even to state a fact , understanding of ideas and concepts is imperative .

In short , understanding of ideas and concepts will help us analyse the facts presented to us .
Besides , it also enables us to memorize the facts and other contents of the subject .
Finally and most important of all these is that , without a proper understanding of the ideas and concepts , we will neither be able to understand nor conclude anything .
So , understanding enables better learning that mere knowing of facts .

"I strongly disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understant ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
There are three below mentioned reasons for the same .

First , if a student has a vague idea of a contructive plan this cannot be put to action without taking facts into considerations .
For example , if a student wants to invent a chemical formula or wants to experiment with chemicals to derive some solution but the fact is that the provided chemistry lab is not having enough facility to do it then its a clear waste of time and his contructive thought is in vain .

Secondly , Ideas are hypothetical and facts are real .
For example , many years ago people used to think that sun revolves round the earth but its just not the fact its vice-versa .
If this was taught to everyone of us till date then it would have been like beleiving on a concept or an idea but the facts were reaveled later .
Hence , hypothetical things may be totally wrong and cannot be taught to students but facts are real and should be taught .

Lastly , Importance of learning the facts makes a student more knowledgable and leads him to better acedemic performances .
For example , If one dose n't know why does the earth rotates round the sun or why day-night occur ?
he would be considered a dumb and illeterate and would not be given any value in this industrialised and competative world .
To be a strong competitor we should be striving for knowledge which is based on facts and not ideas .

The second reason is that students are able to link different subjects at the university , and therefore they can understand much more things in the different subjects .

I often ask my proffesor at the end of the lecture , when I couldnt understand a lot of things in the ideas and concepts , which he or she has presented us .
The reason why I do this , is to capture all the things to understand the idea and concepts .
Otherwise I cant understand the whole lecture , whe i onlz get the facts , e.g numbers or dates .
I also would forget most of the facts , when I only get the facts without learning the ideas and the concepts .

I hope that my collegue will also follow me The above outlined reasons are why I always agree with the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts . ''

"It my belife that whole purpose of education is to train the mind to appreciate , comprehend and eventually implement new ideas and thoughts that come along through the course of one 's life .
Hence , it is essentail not only to understand ideas but to have a will to try and understand ideas .

Unfortunately , we now live in the `` techno-age '' , where is it prime only to deliver , irrespective of how you got to the end result .
Results are of paramount importance as people and businesses have lesser time to spare on details and subtleties .
However , to deliver results effectively and efficiently is it important to know the facts , and to know them well .

Let me try and demonstrate this using the following example .
A students sits-up all night studying for an exam on the ` Indian struggle for Freedom ' .
She feels passionately for the subject , understands the emotions at play and reasons due to which one event led to another .
But , on the day of her exam , she is stunned when she looks at the question paper .
She has been asked questions requirring her to state dates of important events and names of revolutionaries .
She however , was so mesmerized by the determination of the revolutionaries , that she forgot to memorize their names !
Now , although she maybe able describe the freedom struggle as a story , her description will be inaccurate , leading to a low score on the paper .

In conclusion , I 'd like to say that , although learning facts can be as or more difficult than understanding ideas , it is important to be able to do both .
I will go a step further and say that , today everyone is expected to understand ideas and concepts .
What differentiates a winning student from the others is the knowledge of hard facts and a knowledge of how to implement them .

"I would agree with the statement that it is necessary for students to unsersatand the basic ideas than merely learning the facts .
To exemplify , lets take how an engine works .
We may learn many facts about the engine as such or how curiously it works and more .
But knowing the facts about the engine doesnt mean that you are conceptualising the basic idea of its mechanism .
Knowing all the facts doesnot mean that you may be able to repair an engine if it broke down on way .
But understading the mechanism and conceptualising how the engine works would help you a lot .

Just learning facts is only a way of mugging up things .
Facts always remain as facts and it doesnt mean that students are understanding it .
It may teach you right from wrong ones .
But if you try to understand the basic ideas you may be able to build your own answers for many questions .
Students would find this atmost handy while appearing for practical exams .
A student who has understood the concept will develop his own answer from a question even if he is asked an indirect or related question .
Thus you are trying to find out your answer from your own knowledge base which you have conceptualised better rather than merely knowing the fact .

But the students may find it difficult to conceptualise things as it is not easy for all to grab things in the same manner .
For this , it is better to be more pragmatic than reading through books .
It would be better for the students to picturise the mechanism and do it practically .

To quote another example , it is a fact that aeroplanes fly with the help of pressure differences on its wings .
But merely knowing this fact is not sufficient enough .
If you try to understand the idea that an increased velocity of airflow through its wings will create lesser pressure on the surface which gets pushed upwards by the increased pressure at the bottom part , you would conceptualize the idea much faster .
If somenoe can show this with a model or a picture , the students woul understand it better .

Students who have poor ideas or concepts finds themself difficult to get updated with latest innovations and techniques about those subjects .
So understanding the ideas and concepts holds the key for effective learning and success .

"I agree that it is more important and beneficial for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
This is because it is basically the ideas and concepts that lead us to various facts .
Ideas and concepts form the basis of all the learning .
Concept defines the rules and regulations assosciated with a certain term .
If an individual is clear with his concepts , he can understand everything related to that concept .
For example , if a person 's english grammar concepts are clear , then he can understand and write any of the views expressed in English language easily .

Idea is basically a motive behind doing of a certain thing .
Whatever , we do , we do it with some idea at the back of our mind .
For example , if a person is pursuing a management course , he is pursuing it with the idea that a management course will provide him a wide variety of oppurtunities in his career .
Similarly , various ideas form the basis of our different actions i.e drinking water to quench our thirst , eating food to satisfy our hunger .
If a person understand the basic idea behind any task , he will be able to comprehend the implication of that task completely .

Facts are normally stated .
They are the outcome of various observations and experiments performed under certain conditions .
But facts do not always depict truth .
They may be true in one sense but they might be wrong in some other sense .
For example .
if an observation states that a particular type of technology is the most sophisticated technology in its field , this might be true for some but for some whose parameters of observation differs from the parameters of earlier observation might not think so .
Moreover , facts can be altered to meet certain specific objectives .

Hence , I believe that it is more important and essential for students to get hold of ideas and concepts rather than cramming facts .
Understanding ideas and concepts will help them think more logically and practically .
Facts might mislead them but concepts and ideas will always lead them to a logical path .
Understanding of ideas and concepts makes individual 's thought process more effective and efficient .

"I agree that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
Ideas and Concepts are qualities which are inbuilt in ones mind but everyone do n't know the better use of it .
Once the student understands how to frame ideas and how to understand a particular concept he is dealing with than it will help him easy to get his other works done .
On the other hand learning facts is something which the student is going to learn because facts are facts and it wo n't gets changed with time .
But here it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather to learn facts .

This can be best illustrated with an example .
Let us take it for granted that operating a computer or i can say computer knowledge has become a compulsion in todays competitive world .
But to operate computer is not an easy job .
To operate it one should undergo proper coaching regarding the structure & systems in computer .
This is only possible if one has access to understand the concepts regarding various computer programmes .
Once the student learn the concept to create his own ideas and thus use the computer programmes in a better way .
To run a programme is not a fact but it is to be understood with various concepts to be cleared and than to introduce the idea .

Knowledge is Gods gift to all but only few know the better use of it .
For students it is very easy to create new ideas in their mind but until and unless they understand the proper concept behind the idea it is useless .
This cannot be learnt by learning facts .
It becomes important for an individual to plan , understand ant than onlt to implement an idea if and only if the concepts are clear .
But the facts will only lead to what was going on in tha past .
Facts are important but at times they hinder the growth and development by blocking new ideas .

Once the ideas and concepts are cleared in one 's mind than it becomes very easy for a person to learn facts .
On the contrary it proves to be a blessing for the individual because he may create a new marvelous product or design using the facts ant than modifying with new ideas and concepts .
Facts comes from history and will remain till future but new ideas in present will improve one 's future if implemented through studied concepts and visionary ideas .
Thus once again i will say to support the point that it is more importaant for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

"I agree with the statement `` It is more important for atudents to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' Here are a few ponits to impress upon this statement .
First , understanding the concept of a particular idea in a subject provides the student with a not only with clear and strong foundation in that particular subject matter but also enhances and expands their creative aptitude .

For example understanding the concept of the physical formula v = u + at ( where v = final velocity ; u = initial velocity ; a = acceleratoin and t = time ) allows the student to apply the formula to numerous problems in linear motion .
As such , the knowledge gained will allow the student to tackle the problem , however varied its presentation may be .

Secondly , in the feild of medicine , understanding the concept of the cell cycle and mechanisms of tumor spread allows doctors to apprppriately plan the best mode of treatment that they can give to their patients afflicted with cancer , such as radiotherapy , or cell-cycle specific/non-specific chemotherapy .

Also understanding of the concept is important in that knowing the concepts will in itself obviate the need to remember certain hard facts and figures .
For example , the value of `` Pi '' can be easily derived in problems ifd we remember that it is only the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter , rather than remembering all the digits .

To conclude , though facts are important in many ways such as historical dates and events , ( in such circumstances , they are unavoidable ) they are more cumbersome and less useful in lerning especially in the sciences .
Allowing the student to try and understand concepts and ideas will only help him expand his intellectual horizon and creativity as

"Whether understanding ideas and concpets is more important than learing facts is a good point to discuss as there many talks going around regarding changing the study patterns in many universities .

I believe that it is very inportant for student to understand ideas and concepts because the main aim of education is to gain knowledge .

The student goes to school/university in pursuit of knowledge which is based on concepts and ideas .
The facts cannot be understood or related unless the concept behind the fact is known .
For example , one can enjoy beauty of ranibow , but cannot understand how it is formed unless he/she knows the laws of dispersion .

Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts will help student to focus on the studies .
The facts can draw student 's attention in many directions that will not help him gain enough knowledge and depth about the subject .

The understanding of ideas and concepts will help improve thinking ability of a student in right direction .
It can help student concetrate more on any subject .
The ideas and concpets are usually scietifically proven things which makes them are trustworthy .
With only facts , the students can only guess about the reasons behind the facts .
No one can answer the reason behind apple falling down from tree without explaining law of gravity .

The next reason for me to support this point is that understanding ideas and knowledge can make student organize his/her studies in timely manner with proper focus .
This would help a student to gain sufficient knowledge about variety of subjects in a given academic year .
If the students concentrates only on facts , he/she will not be able to pay attention to all the subjects taught in the curriculum .
This will narrow the future scope for the students .

Lastly , I feel that understanding ideas and concepts can help students to come up with new reasearch on certain things happening around us .
The students can form baseline with the help of ideas and concepts already known and can explore the unknown things .
thruogh their research .
This can result in many further developements in our life such as new medicines that are more effective , technology to help improve our day to dat activities , etc ..

With all thes points , I strongly feel that it is more important for stduents to understand ideas and concepts than to leearn facts so as to gaim more knowledge about variety of subjects wihtin give academic time which can help them to broaden their future scope and carrier .

"I totally agree with the statement that ` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . '

Ideas and concepts are quintessential for the development of understanding , propagation of thoughts and enrichment of students .
There is a very strong relation and link that exists between learning of concepts and the ideas that lead to these concepts , or how the ideas are generated and are derived from a particular concept .
All this forms the very basis of knowledge and understanding .
Mere learning of facts without a background would be as futile an activity as dividing a number by zero .

For students or for any learner for that matter , what matters the most is a strong foundation that lies in conceptual knowledge .
Only if the student has the basics right , he can go on and challenge a plethora of theories or formulate hypothesis , proceed towards solving challenging problems , look at things from different perspectives , analyse situations and , may be , develop his own viewpoint on it .
Learning concepts , ideas and also the interrelation between the two , leads a student to build up a knowledge that is relevant or can be definitely counted on .

Take for instance in mathemetics if a student knows the fact that 2 plus 2 is 4 , but does not know how to determine it , the fact would be of no avail .
Similarly if a student of chemistry knows that water is formed by hydrogen and oxygen , but does not understand how the process has taken place the fact will be a non progressive one .
Same goes for other subjects as well .

Hence , it is absolutely necessary for a student to understand the concepts and ideas and then , if necesary , proceed towards the facts .

"IDEAS create imagination , create creativity , create an independent perspective .
The human mind is more likely adaptive to an idea than a fact .
So , i agree with the statement `` it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' First of all , i would like to present a description of what ideas and facts are ?
Ideas are the outcomes of the human enthusiastic and exemplary brain processing , on the other hand facts are mere proved and universally accepted theories , led by the various and respected scientists , biologists , academicians , and philosophers .

Conceptualised thoughts and ideas present an organised and extra ordinary image of the brain working with the human senses proving to be equally creative .
Ideas produce imaginations , which on a more groomed level arise creativity in an individual .
Ideas create history , innovations .
Concepts and ideas combined create new inventions while facts are confined to what they mean .
Their is also liberality in extending an idea and concept .

For example the revolutuionaries and celebrities like Mahatma gandhi , Martin luther king , Mother theresa , Nelson mandela and not to forget the great Adolf hitler , never relied on facts for getting a mass historical transformation and revolution , rather they all used their experienced and practical ideas to implement and bring changes at the global level .

Ideas , though can be percieved in different ways .
For a student , i think ,, the most important way to relate to different aspects of his career is through his reasoning abilities and logical interpretations which are enhanced outcomes of the basic idea he or she clings on to .
Students , in the contemporary world like to be independent , practical and solution oriented .
hence at times facts can help them by proving informative and a short cut to major solution but finally , its the ideas which help a student in his or her long term accomplishments .
AN idea repetitively creates an ability to think beyond certain limits , imbibing certain aspirations in a student .
To fulfill these creative and practical ideas and to implement them in his or her daily life , he or she can reach to greater heights of success .
This mentioned success can be through an artistic idea , a technological idea , a philosophic idea , a mythical idea , or any creative instinct based idea .

So , concuding i strongly believe that an idea or a concept brings out that extraordinary individual in a student which a proof dependent fact cannot .

"A true learning is one where the students are clear with basic ideas and concept of the problem .
This the way by which they can solve many problems without complexities involved in it .
Though , fact about the perticular topic is important to know and it forms an important element , without which learning is incomplete but understanding the ideas and concept are equally required .

for example , a child wants to learn about how to solve a mathematical problem like addition or substraction .
Then it is very important that he knows the concept of the problem .
It is important for him to identify where he has to add up and where he has to substract .
This will help him out to solve similar kind of problem in future , only becuase the ideas and the concepts are clear to him .

Further , we can learn the facts only by making inferences and drawing conclusions which involves the complete understanding of ideas .
only then it will be possible to reach to a conclusion and eventually to learn about the fact .
For example this is the fact that earth is the only planet where life exists .
The main ideas and reasons behind it are becuase of the favourable atmosphere , presence of oxygen , earths distance from the sun etc.these things helps us to make a conclusion about existence of life on earth .
Which is the fact .

In other words , the concept of a model which was suggested by a scientist with sun at the centre in the planet system , one can give reasons and explain the fact that earth is locatedat a perticular distance .
so , what is more important is , to first have a basic idea about a concept and then learn the fact which is associated to it .
This is the way any problem can be solved with better understanding and improved learning ability .

"The issue of `` Understanding ideas and concepts , than to learn facts '' , is quite an interesting , raising significant interest in today 's world of competition and survival of the fittest .
Many students believe that facts are more important than understanding ideas and concepts , and at first glance it appears to provide an adequate solution .
However , when juxtaposed with the alternative of understanding ideas and concepts , the solution of learning facts appears less convincing .
The importance to understand ideas and concepts has several advantages over learning facts as mentioned below .

Firstly , by understanding ideas and concepts , students can apply the knowledge they gain while studying , to the careers they pursue later on in their life .
For example a car mechanic , who understands how the machinery in a car functions , can easily diagnose the problem a car is facing , when the car is brought to the workshop .
This can make him a better car mechanic , with experience he can go on to become a successful manager in an automotive shop , and someday own his own automotive company .

Secondly , a better understanding of different subjects taught in schools and colleges , can have many different benefits .
Let us take the example of a biology student .
What he learns during his biology class can be applied to real world situations .
He learns that growing trees can cause so many health benefits by improving the functioning of our ecosystem .
Planting trees in an area can increase the amount of rainfall , thus solving a water shortage problem .

There are many good reasons for the opposing argument to argue that to learn facts is sufficient .
However it does not have the several advantages which understanding ideas and concepts has , as mentioned above .
Such as better career growth and benefits to the society and environment .
Thus I would like to conclude that understanding ideas and concepts provides a much better solution as it is not undermined by potential drawbacks .

"In order to understand something student should have a basic ideas about it .
I agree with the statement that it is more significant for the student to understand ideas and conept because in order for having a vast knowledge about any thing we should have a idea or concept which can be applied later in the practical life .

One reason for my belief is that in order to have a overall knowledge about any equipment or any subject , it takes time therefore student should learn ideas and concept .
Suppose we take a case of a person who want to become a pilot , so inorder to become a pilot , he should have to understand ideas and concept about the various mechanism in the aeroplane instead of driving it .
He can drive it better if he can have a better understanding about the concept and ideas then he can apply these in driving the aeroplane .

Second reason for my belief is that inorder for the accurate knowledge for the subjects it is better for the student to have a clear understanding about ideas in their class room because i feel that for a flawless knowledge we should have our concept cleared in classroom .
Suppose a student want to work on a computer aided machine which is a very expensive machine and quite vulnerable to fault if not handled properly , then in these case without having a knowledge of concept and ideas to handle it , student can cause a problem to the machine resulting in failure .

Finally , I feel that in the student life there are too much concept which are to learn , they had less time to complete their subject syllabus , therefore they should firstly complete the course in their school otherwise less time will harm their academic career .

However for the proper study of the a subject , student should have a hand to hand knowledge of fact also these will help in acquiring profound knowlege of the subject .

In conclusion , I agree with the statement that the student should understand ideas and concept which will be more benefical for them .

"I would strongly agree with this statement .
In today 's learning environment , a student needs to focus on qualitative learning as opposed to quantitative learning .
A need for comprehension of the concepts and ideas becomes increasingly important for a person to achieve success in his/her life .

As a child , Benjamin Franklin was relieved of studying at junior school since he would not learn up everything that he was required of him , which he believed it to be unnecessary as they were already provided .
He went on to later become one of the greatest inventors of all time .
Now I am do not believe that school is not important , but that these ` facts ' , which are merely clusters of information , are actually derived from ideas that other people once had .
Once a concept is understood , the idea can always be derived .
Once a theorem is known , a derivation can be made .

In contrast , if a student is made to only learn facts with lesser importance given to ideas , then that student may not be able to contribute to many aspects that require thinking in his life .
If everyone were taught to do something but not told why it is done or what principle underlies it , then innovation would become an extinct concept .
I would next like to highlight another important result - innovation .
It is the only thing that has given us what we have today ; this PC that I am operating on , the ETS testing system and countless other things .
Complacency would really bring us back to the stone age .

In conclusion , if we were to only learn facts and figures , then we would not require schools in the first place .
Everyone would be academically equal or based on the capacity of his/her memory , which would be a large encumberance to progress .
This is the reason that all universities stress on concept learning than ` mugging up ' .
To conclude , I would say that this statement is perfectly right and that it should prevail .

"I agree with the statement that it is important for the students to understand the concepts and ideas well and not just learn the facts .
The main reasons for my view are given below .

First reason for my veiw is that we need to implement the ideas and concepts in real life and just learned facts will not help our cause .
What we learn in school or college is of importance in real life and we need to implement it in real life scenarios , so just by learning the facts we wo n't be able to implement them .
Concepts of Physics or chemistry , which are essential in our day to day life , will never be clear to us .
We can learn that earth rotates around the sun , but we will never understant the reason for the same until we understand the concepts and ideas behind the factors like rotation and gravity .
So just learning facts we limit our knowledge and understanding of the small small things which we have to deal in daily life and from time to time .

Second reason for my view is that the learned facts are easily forgotten as compared to ideas and concepts which we understand well .
We do n't forget the concepts which we understand well and are able to remember them a long time .
The students who just learn for exams have less knowledge and forget the subject early as compared to those who understand the concepts .

However , it is also sometmes neccessary to just learn the facts and not understand .
Like the case of History subject .
We are not required to understand the concepts just learn and know the facts .

In conclusion , it is important to understant the concepst and ideas as we need to implement them in our daily life and also we tend to remember the concepts which are well understood as compared to just learning them .
But there are situations where just learning is required like the case of knowing the History subject .

"I strongly agree that students should learn the ideas and concepts of anything rather than learning only the facts .

The points which i will cover are as below :
# Ideas and concepts reveals the actual knowledge of the student .
# Facts could be an illusionary knowhow about the subject .
# Conceptual knowledge makes a deep impact on the colleagues and professors and to attain more of the credits .
# Facts could be somewhat useful or maybe considered for timebeing but ideas generating the facts would be the ones every individual is interested to know .
# Importance of deep knowledge in today 's competitve world .
# Conclusion

As a saying goes on :

`` Half - Knowledge is dangerous '' .

The very friends of a man are always `` WHO '' , `` WHY '' , `` WHAT '' , `` WHERE '' .
And these all leads us to know the ideas and concepts behind every invention , every fact , every rule , every quote , every event that occurs or happens .
I would not be wrong if i say that i usually like to carry these four questions with me when ever i move to unkown place or to any interesting place .

Well , starting up with the essay i would like to stress on the point of `` Complete - Knowledge '' .
I suppose that this term is mentioned by me just to make my point self-explanatory .
Infact , i would say that a person with knowledge is the one appreciated everywhere .

And the matter is simply that a student will be able to get more of the grades and could get more attention if he has the collection of various innovative ideas accompanied with the facts told by him .

Now for example , a student preparing for any of the project presentation will have to elaborate and present his knowledge and research related to the topic of the project .
And in this case it would definitely be the best part for the student to collect the facts related to his project and to make them know how they were possible ?
Would n't that be a fantastic thing done by the student to make his classmates introduce with a new topic and in an educational way ?

Ofcourse it would be !
But i am not completely disagreeing with the point that knowhow of facts is also important sometimes .
`` As i believe something is better than nothing '' .
But usually facts turns out to be an illusionary concept with no basis to support .
This may lead a student to a condition of `` Nowhere '' .

But surely , a student will be able to get more of the accolades , extol , credits , grades on his complete and deep knowledge based on facts and figures .

Today 's competitive world demands knowledge with deep roots to sustain in the developing and fast - growing companies .
Every day new inventions and creations are forcing the companies to seek great minds to get in their company and in lieu to this great minds , always an acutal knowledge is required .

Still , a student should for sure attain as much knowledge as possible only to survive and to rise in this competitive world and prove his worth .
He should gain more and more facts and work out the ways through which thises facts have been developed .
His research probably would then be the most attractive part of his resume for a company to hire him .

Hence , knowledge is important and somehow with a basi and so ideas , concepts and facts together be the best part of having sound knowledge in a student life .

"I do not subscribe to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
Students should be more focussed on getting the facts right as facts hold them are unalterable and are bound to hold them good in long stead .
What may seem a great idea to one person may be perceived as unfeasible and dismissed by another idea from person who has taken a different approach .

Ideas can be whimsical and outlandish .
They can even range from bizzare to plain absurd .
It is here that facts stop whimsical ideas to take flight and cause unnecessary wastage of time and effort by a team of creators .

Let me quote a recent example .
Donald Trump , the real estate mogul from New York , mooted the idea of the new season of hit TV series , The Apprentice on racial lines .
The contest was previously held between university graduates and non degree holders .
For the latest season he came up with the idea of the contest taking place between colored and white people .
The idea , before it could shape up further , drew huge criticism and widespread uproar among the society as to how come racism form the basis of a tv show that is essentially a recruitment process which is broadcast all over the country and abroad forcing Trump to abandon the idea and issue an apology .

This idea would never have been come up , if Donald Trump had acquainted himself with the fact , that anything remotely racist would be condemned widespread as racism in any form is still a sensitive issue .

This is not to say that ideas and concepts should be trashed away completely .
They should be allowed to prosper only after the facts have been taken into account .
Facts form the basis of ideas and concepts and unless a student has got his facts in place , he will not be able to come up with original and progressive ideas .

"In the era of science and technology , the people generally pay more attention to short path for learning rather than long path such as deep understanding of ideas and concepts .
Everyone has different perspective of education .
So , when I am thinking by considering all the points , I conclude that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
I hold several reasons derived from my personal experience for holding this opinion .

First , more emphases should be placed on the way in which the ideas are derived .
This is possible only if person understands ideas and concept .
For instance , if I dont know Newtons Law of Motion , i am not able to establish a stucture of steamer .
And evenif I have structeured it would be captivated soon , because of misdesign .
So , just learning facts how to manufacture the steamer does n't ensure me the effective working of it .

Moreover , for innovations understanding of ideas and concepts is necessary .
Most of the investigations concur with the fact that understanding of concept lead to development of facts .
For example , understanding of the mechanism of action of a drug on receptor , derives the fact wheather the drug will have side effects or not .

It is impossible for any psychologist to deny the fact that learning fact is short term memory , while understaning the same thing is long term memory .
So , understanding will not limit your knowledge till writing a test , but throughout your life time .
Eventually , this knowledge can be utilised in constuctive and innovative way .
For example , when i was little , my teacher told me to understand ideas of cell biology .
On that platform , ultimately I developed a model showing different physicochemical reactions occuring in the cell .

In summary , I found that , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept , because some of the many advantages of understanding ideas and concepts include long term memory , basic manufacturing sence and innovative ideas which creat a fact .

"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .

An education based on the ` why ' behind many different topics will provide a holistic education to students .

Students will have clearer pictures .
A student will learn a few factual information while he or she is in the process of learning an idea or a concept .
The student will become more creative .
The student will be in position to contribute more meaningfully to different discussions with different groups of people .
Such learning help student build some skill sets such as soft skills related to analysis , thinking .
Also , students feel encouraged to opt for constructive environment in which the learning is based on ideas and concepts .
Students feel no undue stress on remembering facts as just remembering facts are not going to help in the long run .

Instead of remembering some rules or incidents as mere facts , the student will be in position to question the existing those rules and incidents .
There are chances that more new ideas and concepts will be generated .
For example , recent changes such as orgnanized producers in retail sectors have resulted in better and efficient processes for the end customers .

In today 's online world , the factual information is easily available .
Students do not need to do any rote learning .
Also , learning facts hampers a student development .
Students will rely on memory for such a trivial case about which information is easily available .
For example , a trivial case would be that how many bones are present in human body .
There is no need to learn such facts .
Instead , once the student is aware that the number of bones can vary during the different stages of life or can vary due to some external factors .
The student will be in more position to understand the reasons for such a varied number .

"The statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts might have varied opinion depending on how a person takes it but I myself agree to the statement .

For me if a student understands the idea and the concept about a particular topic , the student can get a clear picture of as to how that particular concept came into being by knowing the basics for it without ever getting the thought that how did he for that matter reach to this conclusion .
Whereas had the student just learned the facts , he would be just having sort of an overview of the topic without knowing any in-depth details about that particular concept and still might have so many questions regarding the topic which he might have not been able to answer by learning the facts .

Another point to understanding ideas and concepts is that upon understanding them , it would stay in students head longer and may be permanently as by understanding he would be knowing as to how a particular concept or idea evolved .
He would be knowing the fundamentals for the idea or concept and once a student is clear with his fundamentals I personally think there should not be any problem anytime recalling it .
This is not the case with leaerning just the facts , as one would have to keep going back to his notes or books to memorize them as the fundamentals have not been instilled into his mind which would have been the case if he might have understood it .

Besides the student can also try and relate to that particular idea , which they can later narrate with ease whenever asked to do so , if he understands that particular idea , without much of straining or stressing .
While this might not be the case if the student is acquainted with just the facts , as learning the facts without knowing the basics for them is equivalent to or rather is cramming which does n't help much and rather might end up pretty confused instead .

An example supporting the above points that I made would be of a biology student .
Had the student just learned the fact about a ecology flowchart for a particular group of animals it would be okay , but might face problems when a question comprising another group of animals is given to him as he has n't understood the basic principles onto which relationship between various animals is based .
On the other hand a student who understands the concept for it will have no problem of answering the question anytime as it is all crystal clear in his mind .

"I agree that it is very essential for students to understand ideas and concepts .
There is a saying that if you give a man a fish to eat he will eat only for one day , but if you teach him how to fish he will have food to eat for the rest of his life .
The same principle applies here : If a students merely memorises or learns the facts without understanding the reason behind it he will have to keep going back and reviewing over and over again to remember the material , but if he understands the reasoning behind it , he will never forget it .

Let me explain my reasoning using an example from physiology .
In physiology we learn that the Sodium potassium pump is very essential for the functioning of the body .
The sodium is present outside the cell and the potassium is inside the cell .
exchange of these ions occurs with the help of the sodium - potassium ATPase pump .
sodium can come in and out of the cell through the voltage gated channels but potassium does not need these channels .
It has ungated channels .
It leaks out of the cell constantly .
If this pump is disrupted due to injury , sodium gets trapped inside of the cell and this causes the swelling of the cell .
this is what we see when a person is injured , or when they have a heart attack or when they have a stroke .
If the student does n't understand the simple mechanism of this pump , he will keep learning about swelling in different areas of the body without being able to link it to one small process and keep learning the same thing over and over again without making a connection and wasting his valuable time .

Therefore , I believe that every student should first be able to understand the concepts before they proceed to study something new .
Most of the new stuff We learn is an old idea in a new package with a different fancy name .

"I strongly agree to the statement that for students ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .
The following essay will illustrate this and explain why it is so .

Ideas come from the creativity with in aperson .
A person who has the capability to develop an idea of its own can do anything .
He/she can produce many facts from the ideas .
Ideas acts as the source of many inovations .
Thus a person with great idea will never be dependent on facts but will always create things on his/her own .

Concepts also play very important role in the process of learning .
To work in any field one has to learn the basics of that field .
It is a very simple statement but it stands quite good .
In any institution a student should invest most of his/her time in learning the basics and the concepts of a particular field .
A person with a strong base of knowledge can bring in astonishing chages in his/her field of study .

In our histtory if we have seen that great inventions , either by Newton or an unknown scientist , always had a stong backup of in-depth knowledge of the field .
If we see the paintings of Leonardo Do Vinci , those are based on the ideas and imaginations which he had and on which he had given remarkable belongings to the world .

Although , a small connsideration goes sometime to facts as it helps in strenthening ones ideas which has been developed by using the concepts of the field .
But ultimately its your own originality which can bring flying colours .

In the end I would conclude that ideas and concepts are more important than the learning the fact .
So students should concentrate more on getting the concepts and enhancing thier ideas rather than memorizing the facts .

"I strongly believe that that the students must understand ideas and concepts about a partricular topic and subject rather than just learn facts without understanding anything .
It is most important for the student to first understand the contents of the subject because one cannot know about the topic of the subject without understanding anything about the ideas and concepts of the subject .
Just craming about anything is a wishful thing without understanding the subject .
For example I a student of Chemistry , in Chemistry there are various types of complicated and difficult theories , laws and reactions .
If i cannot understand the basic concept of the reaction how can I learn it and though Chemical reactions are so much tough , and complicated no one can learn it and write in the examination without understanding the basic concept about the chemical reactions that is how it happens ? , how the reaction proceeds ?
and What are the products formed after the completion of Chemical reaction .
For example take the process of formation of rust in Iron , no student can learn its facts without understanding the basic concent of rusting of iron and I am sure that no student can learn its chemical reaction without understanding what are the compound involved in the rusting of iron and what is the formulae of the reactants and products formed in the process of rusting of iron If the student does n't know names of the reactants and products in the rusting of iron then how can he or she knoes the formulae and the most important thing in knowing the formulae is to first know the symbols of the elements involved in the compounds of rectants and products .
The reactants involved in the rusting of iron are ferric oxide , oxygen , water in the form of moisture and they all combine to form ferrisoferric oxide known as rust .
so for this to learn and write in the examination the student first has to understand the proceess and conditions involved in the rusting of iron and the student must know the symbols of the elements involved and then only the student can write the formulea of all the reactants and products involved in the rusting of iron .
In this way the student can explain the process of rusting of iron and write it properly in the exam by understanding the basic ideas and concepts involved in this particular process of risting of iron .

In the same way the student can write the chemical reaction of the process of photosynthesis by understanding that it invoves oxygen and carbondioxide to form carbohydrate Thus all branches of science can only be studied by understanding ideasn and concepts

"I strongly agree with the statement that it is important for the students to understand the ideas and basic concepts of the particular course they are learnig .
Simply learning the course will only get them minimal grades if it is a theoretical subject .
But the few subjects which require the in-depth basic knowledge would surely not work in favor of such students .
I can elaborate on this from my personal experience .
During my graduation course in Mechanical Engineering I came across diversified subjects .
Few of them were really not of my very interest but I cleared those subjects with the utmost concentration and honesty .

Subjects like engineering drawing , design of machine elements , dynamics of machinery , etc really requires a great in-dept knowledge and strong basic concepts .
What we learn from the text books is just from theoretical point of view but at the same time to relate it with the actual practical experince is very difficult .
If the student has all his basic knowledge about the subject clear then he can really relate the book information with the practical field .

If a student is having his basic concepts clear about the subject then he can really continue to learn more about that subject and will be able to grasp on that topic more easily .

Simply learing the subject because it is mentioned in the syllabus is no good .
This type of attitude will not result any thing positive in his/her favor .
For any one having a partial or superficial knowledge is dangerous .
Such students after their graduation when enter into relative company will find very difficult to acclimate themself with the type of work being done .
Because they do n't actually know how the particular process is caried out or how the particular machine works .
At that time they will try and learn about that process which they are actually supposed to do in their graduation course .
At the same time student who has donw with his graduation course with utmost interest and honesty will enjoy working out in the company and will ascend the success ladder must faster than the less interested student .

In all , students should always try and relate the things which they have learned in books with the practical knowledge ; which every one learns during his/her daily life .
When a person relates his work or tries to explain the concept about a particular topic to another person he not only helps the other person but also bolster his own confidence and knowledge about that subject .
Person can do this only if he has a good understanding about the subject .

"I completely agree with the statement that it is essential for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .
This exercise is even more essential during early stages in their development .
This is because understanding ideas and concepts helps to develop a student 's mind .
Understanding an idea or concept encourages the student to apply his/her mind and come up with logical explanations , solutions and conclusions .
The student tends to develop analytical thinking and reasoning abilities .
He/she tends to becomes inquisitive and curious , constantly seeking information and looking out for answers .
He/she tends to participate more in discussions and debates , which help him to learn from other people and undertand their line of thinking .
He/she also tends to become more creative and contributive .
And , these are essentially qualities which employers seek when hiring potential employees .
This is the reason that companies stress more on personal interviews rather than written tests when hiring .
They look out for the essential qualities of analytical thinking , reasoning and creativity , all which stem from having the ability to understand ideas and concepts and connect things .

Learn facts is an exercise which is essentially done over a period of a person 's lifetime .
Often , facts that students learn in their school and college life may become outdated as science and technology progresses and new inventions and discoveries are made .
Hence to remain updated in a competitive world , a person is required to learn facts throughout his lifetime .

In conclusion , learning facts does improve a student 's knowledge base but unless he is equipped with analytical thinking and reasoning abilities he is less likely to make an impact which will help him to succeed in the longer run .

"I agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .
In the following paragraphs i will try to defend my stand using various reasons and arguments .

Any learning process is useful only when it has some real world applications and makes a significant contribution to the life and personality of the learner .
Just take an example of any engineering or science subject .
You know that an induction motor produces electricity in such and such way , and that this type of combustion may give this result .
But what is the use of these facts learned ?
The learning is complete only when you see that motor installed anywhere and doing something that is very useful for the individual or community , like drawing water from a deep bore and when you go to any smelting unit and see the same combustion process being used to process metals and make alloys .

So , we can say that to understand concepts and ideas is actually application based learning whereas learning facts is just theoratical learning .
Unless theoratical learning is complemented with application based learning , the entire learning process remains incomplete for an individual .

This does not apply only to science and technology subjects .
Consider a student of dramatics , studying a subject , say `` Shakspear 's Plays '' .
He can very well learn the entire plot and scenes , story of any play , but how will that do any good to him ?
Only when he is able to understand the messages and implications , like what is the emotional aspect of the play , why is a particular character behaving in a particular manner , what were the circumstances in writer 's life under which he wrote the play , that his learning can be said to be complete .

So we can safely conclude that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .

"I am in complete agreement with the given statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .

Ideas and concepts are very important and they act the source of general conscience in human being .
I feel so because understanding ideas and concepts is far more important than just learning facts only .
If a student is clear about the concept and idea behind a phenomenon than it will hardly take a second to learn the fact .
It is concepts and ideas that give rise to facts or one can say that fact is denouement of ideas and concepts .
To clearly undersatnd take an example of `` falling of a hurling ball on the ground '' .
This falling of a ball on ground is a fact but the force of gravity and the phenomenon of gravitation comes under ideas and concepts behind this fact .
So just learning that a hurling ball falls on ground is trivial as compared to the concept of gravitation .

Also learning facts does not count to intelligentia , one shuld have logical thinking and innovative ideas to get success in any field .
Logical thinking is the path to success .
And logical thinking develops only when one think innovative ideas or mere ideas , So one should think newer and newer ideas to solve a problem .
Thinking innovative ideas leads to logical thinking and reasoning .
As everybody is familier with the milieu of competition , so to survive and compete in this competitive environment the students shoould be ancouraged

The students should be encouraged to go for understanding of ideas and concepts instead of learning of facts only .
If the students are good then the institute will also succeed and definitely the country too .
So to make future generations better and competitive the students should be encouraged to understand ideas and concepts rather than mere facts only .

"Chancing opon this issue reminds me of a literary character that we are all probably familiar with ; Private Quelch , in the short story ` The man who knew too much ' .
A characterer that epitomizes the issue at hand for Private Quelch was an over-knowledgeable army serviceman who found himself in dire situations because of his blatant exhibition of that knowledge .
The story potrayed to us what becomes of a man wih too much knowledge but hardly any concept of how to use it .
Quelch found that he always dragged himself too deep into unpleasant situations , pompously armed with just his knowledge .

It is of no doubt then that I completely agree with the idea that it is vital for us to understand ideas and concepts than it is to merely mug facts .
Being in the third year of engineering , I have millions of firm reasons to believe that plain bookish knowledge can only get us so far .
After that it is the clarity that we have in our concepts and our developed understanding that help us proceed .
And when it comes to students , boy , they sure need to have thier fundamentals clear and precise !

A student who just mugs up books , and merely ` vomits out ' all the stored information onto his papers , might do well in a few cases , but when it comes to higher learning , the student will need to adapt to understanding or his knowledge is simply wasted .
Questions of application can never be answered by such a student .

Learning facts is probably what would be beneficial to students in a general knowledge quiz , but it is defintely not something that should be completely overlooked .
After all , what good are concepts when one simply cannot remember the facts they were made to explain ?
Can a student ace his exams by just keeping his concepts crystal clear ?
Will he not need some facts hidden in the recesses of his brains o refer in different circumstances ?
Facts like formulae , values , constants and exceptions .
He will most certainly need those facts to help with his everyday studies .

Nowadays , even the internet provides students with an unlimited resource of information .
It is upto the students then , to properly sift through all that immeasurable amount of knowledge , and extract concepts and maerials that is actually practical for him or her to know .

So what a student should not do , is to mechanically rote subjects .
He 'll never reach too far if he does only that .
He should have an appropriate combination of facts and fundamentals , with ideas and fundamentals taking much higher priority .
Trivial facts can mostly be referred from ready-reckoners while others may need to be stored in our brains .

Hence , the adage ` Knowledge is Power ' is hardly true .
Wisdom of how to apply that knowledge correctly , is probably what power mostly comprises of .

"Different people can have different opinion about this topic .
some will go for understanding the ideas by keeing their point of view as - learning can be made easier by understanding the ideas .
But some consider learning facts are more important then understanding the ideas .

Considering from my point of view - I totally concede with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand the ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn the facts '' .

I endorse my view by saying that `` learnig in depth can result in more innovations '' .
It is very important for a student to understand the basic fundamental of the problem .
suppose if a student is solving the problem related to mathmatics and he is doing calculus , then it would be quite difficult for the student to solve the problem by just remembering the facts there , instead if he knows the basic formulas and method use those formulas according to the question it would be easier to solve the problem .

In the second place `` to be practical '' it is necessary to have full fleged knowledge about the subject and the concepts behind that. , And scientist have proved that .
They may not be able to find new innovations by just learnig facts .

By knowing the ideas afer the situtation it becomes easier to have a command over that .

"It has been said that knowledge and free thinking form the basis of any successful society .
The maxim completely describes todays world which has seen a tremendous desire to achieve milestones previously unimaginable .

For any society to grow we require an understanding of previous knowledge and also an account of our past achievements .
But would it not cause stagnation if the sole purpose of learners was to be aware of these facts and learn them ?
Progress can only be made if we analize our past and learn from them .
Analizing can only come through a proper understanding of ideas and concepts .
Luckily throughout history we have seen mavericks , be it Galileo or Newton or even someone as recent as Einstein , who went against the tide to come up with ideas that allowed the next generations to flourish .

Were it not for our unending thirst for knowledge we would still be living in the stone age .
This is self evident fron the way kids grow and learn from their surroundings .
A baby may never learn how to walk or talk if its brain did not possess the ability to grasps the required steps involved in this complex process .
In this case it may be understanding subconsciously but if we want a robot to simulate the actions of a child we would first require a complete understanding of the involved steps .
Only after this can we put newer ideas into making machine emulate man .

"I disagree that it is important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for the to learn facts because in todays world , in order to achieve success a careful planning is needed and planning cannot be done without facts and figures .
For instance , if a scientist has an idea or a belief , than he needs to experiment it to get facts that support the belief and than when he gets this supportive facts than the theory becomes a law and would accepted universally .
So , in order to prove any thought belief and idea the facts are required .
Moreover , students should learn about facts and this will not only help them in their future job but also in every desicion either personal or professional which they make , will be much more realiable and result would be certain and fruitful .

While knowledge and understanding of ideas and concepts is also nesseary as without them the person would not be able to set goals in live and direct his full energy to achieve it nor he will be able to gain success in life .

For example , suppose an employee has been given a project .
So , the employee needs to study it than understand the concept , plan a idea , plan a stratergy , do research and find factsand figures which support the concept and on the basis of these facts he could also estimate the profits and submit the report , than the deal would be signed and succes in profits desired would be achieved and his work would be appreciated and he might get rewards for it .
Thus the knowledge of concept and idea is important but facts are the evidences thus , when support the former than it is implemented and the success is confirmed .
Whereas , the employee could also complete the report by indicating the facts and figures and submitting it , But an efficient , employee would study find pros and cons and evaluate the deal ability to provide desired profits that are expected by the owner and thus work for betterment of his company .

In today 's world the quality of the education system has certainly gone down .
Now a these days more stress is being put on the students to learn facts rather than focusing on the understanding of ideas and concepts .
eg : A student is stressed to learn when the World War II started or which countries were fighting in the war rather than providing an understanding to them whether the war was necessary or not ?
What could be the consequences of another war of the same sort taking place in the future ?

In today 's world one has to be innovative , creative and original .
The education system in today 's world does not input any of these qualities in a child .
These qualities can only be inputted through proper understanding of ideas and concepts and not by mere facts .

"I am in complete agreement of the statement that its more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , due to several reasons .

First , understanding of any concept or idea or one can say the concept behind the idea will ultimately lead to the `` fact '' .
At this stage students will be able to figure out the underlying principles behind the fact .
In other words they will be able to understand the principle governing a fact .
For example , if you throw anything upwards it will come down , this is a fact .
Now in other words we can define this phenomenon by first introducing the concept of Gravitational Force .
Moreover if add a little detail to the concept that if something is thrown at its certain velocity will not return to earth , it becomes more interesting .
Now at this stage the student has understanding of the concept fo gravitaion .
He will be able to understand the rules guiding the fact and he would move one step further to understand that critical `` velocity '' .
This makes learning more fun and open doors for exploring ideas .

Secondly , learning only facts without their understanding will invoke sense of mugging .
The students will not bother about the hidden principles and this will restrict their scope of education .
In the general situation also we hardly bother about other routs to a destination if we have a shortcut , if it fullfils your requirement , even though its congested and polluted .
So its a general human tendency .

Finally , if we limit our scope of knowledge then what would happen to the billions of books in the liberary ?
Isnt it worth thinking of ?
Access to the knowledge is a fundamental rite , limiting learning to facts only will definetely hamper in one or the other way of a persons fundamental rite .

Today the concepts and facts that i need to learn are not very easy .
Definately , a lot of hard work goes into learning them !
But , if i sit down and understand why and what i am doing. , then it definately makes it much simpler for me to go through an entire chapter .

I would also like to put down the fact that i am a student who has shifted from the normal C.B.S.E an indian borad to the International Baccalaureate because of one simple reason .
At my earlier school the standard norm was that of rote-learning .
We would just have to mug up the entire text book and regurgirate it on our exam papers ..
but my current school helps us understand what we are doing .
They make us do activities and give us explanantions on what we are going to do and why .
This really helps me and my peers to learn faster .

So , I very strongly believe that what ever we do has to have a great deal of understandingbehindit , before we jump in to learn the facts .

We should always ask ourselves a set of standard questions before we jump into a task or start learning facts that we dont undersatnd or we dont have the basic knowledge about .

why is it that i'am doing this ?
WHAT ?
what is it that i am doin ?

"The life is practical not theoritical .
To live in this practical world the every student should know the facts about the life .
But there are some places for those the person has to understand the ideas and concepts of the things .
I think that the students should understand the ideas and concepts as it is an important part of their education but it is more important for them to understand and know the facts about the things and life .
The following passages will explain the reasons for my opinion .

Firstly , a person cannot live in the world just by having the ideas and concepts , they have to become the practical in their life .
So if students start learning the facts from their primary education then they will be able to work in their field more successfully .
I can explain my view with an example , there are so many books that students read while doing the MBA or other management courses but when it comes to practical while doing the job most of them are not useful , so at that time the students are required to learn the facts .
Like many books says that a manager should not tell any thing worng to his employees and should not hide and fact or any information from his employees but there are several conditions when the management is required to hide the things and some information fromt he employee .
For example if the team is working on the some secret project then in these comdition the the manager is required to hide the important information from the team .
So if the students will learn these facts from their child hood they will become a better manager or better person in their field .

Secondly , if the students will learn these facts from the primary school then it will also save their time .
As most of their time goes in learing only the ideas and concepts .

Finally there are also some benefits of learing the ideas and facts in the student life .
A student will get more knowlede and will be having better ability to understand the things .
For example , an engineering student has to learn practical things in his life at the last .
But if he will be having the better concepts and idea that how is work done and how are the requirements of a good job then he will be able to perform well .

In sum , i think that the students should be given the knowledge about both the things that is about the facts and about the ideas and concepts .
As both plays their important role in the life of a student both are important for a successful person .
But more importance should be given in teaching about the facts rather than the ideas and concepts .

"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Stepping out of one's comfort zone and embracing challenges is often a key factor in achieving success.

Firstly, trying new things and taking risks can lead to personal growth and development. By venturing into uncharted territories, individuals can expand their skill sets, gain new perspectives, and foster creativity. Embracing challenges allows individuals to push their boundaries and discover hidden talents and passions they may not have known existed.

Secondly, taking risks can lead to greater opportunities and rewards. Success rarely comes from playing it safe and sticking to the familiar. By taking calculated risks, individuals open doors to new possibilities, experiences, and achievements. Whether in business, academia, or personal endeavors, those who are willing to step outside of their comfort zones are more likely to reap the benefits of their efforts.

For example, many successful entrepreneurs attribute their achievements to their willingness to take risks and try new approaches. Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc., was known for his bold innovations and willingness to challenge the status quo, leading to the creation of revolutionary products that changed the tech industry.

In conclusion, while sticking to what one knows best may provide a sense of security, true success often lies in embracing the unknown and taking risks. By stepping out of their comfort zones, individuals can unlock their full potential, seize new opportunities, and ultimately achieve greater success in various aspects of life.",P8,HIN,high,1
"I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. It is through stepping out of one's comfort zone and embracing challenges that individuals truly grow and achieve success.

Musk has a reputation for taking bold risks by investing in groundbreaking technologies that others deemed too risky. Despite facing numerous setbacks and failures along the way, his willingness to explore uncharted territories has ultimately led to revolutionary advancements in the electric car and space exploration industries.

Similarly, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, faced rejection from multiple publishers before finally finding success. Had she not persisted in trying something new and taking a risk by pursuing her passion for writing, the world would have been deprived of one of the most beloved literary works of our time.

In essence, success often lies at the intersection of courage and curiosity.

He sticks to what he knows best and does not take unnecessary risks. His success is a testament to the fact that one can excel by mastering a particular skill rather than constantly seeking new challenges.

Success often hinges on the willingness to venture into uncharted territories and embrace the unknown. In my opinion, I firmly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only sticking to what they are already proficient in.

"I strongly agree with the fact that successful people are avid risktakers .
But first lets specify what success means ??
Success not only means to be happy in terms of wealth , fame and appreciation , it also has a lot of bearing to self-satisfaction and the feeling of being at peace with oneself .

Only if successful people cared about fame and money then I surely think that percentage of successful people living would have been far higher than it exists .
The reason being there are defined and speculative ways for ganing wealth and fame or making pots of money .
But for being successful in truest sense you have to be a risk taker .
Not essentially in terms of an explorer amid the ghostly white setup of Artic in his mission to reach the pole , but also in terms of an individual whose philosophy involves inviting new ideas , redefining the conventions and more importantly unlearing the redundant practices .

The people we today see enjoying corporate success , political success or even as movie stars have one thing in common .
They dared to look beyond what was obvious .
Then they took the next step or `` risk '' of questioning it and redefining it with a new startegy .
Thus not only Warren Buffet , Fidel Castro and Robin Williams did that they changed the way people look at the usual and maybe mundane workings of earning profits , driving a nation and being an accomplished actor .

This kind of reversal and effective transition of the geography of tasks , work and assignments in to challenges and goals is what defines successful people from rest of the lot .
I firmly believe that certain degree of non-conformity and questioning of dogmatic beliefs is also an ingredient to take your success to the next level .

People would ridicule you , laugh at you or even hurl abuses at you but remember companies like Apple Inc. were n't born out of cosy cushions of money and self apprasing practices .
It grew rapidly due to creativity and innovative ideas which also involve considerable risk and questioning but payback is healthy and self satisfactory .

To summarize the essay the society should be made of free thinkers and risk takers alongwith people who understand there vision , garner it and substantiate it into a reality .
",P8,HIN,high,0
"I completely agree with the statement .
According to me , Success cannot be acheived by a particular formula or a so called tried and tested method .
To become successful you need to have your own new or derived set of ideas that you think will make you successful .

If you have to acheive great success you have to come up with new ideas otherwise you will lose or at the maximum be moderately successful .
For eg. We all know about the `` easy '' group which is headed by Mr. Stelios .
When he tried to venture in Cruise business there were preset notions and fixed rules like the Ship had to be always be on Sea and all the luxuries of life were to be enjoyed there .
Moreover , the average age of Cruise goer was in 50's .
Stelios completely revamped this strategy and brought his ideas .
His prime area of thinking was that the cruise should attract younger people .
So he developed his own way by bringing in new concept of low cost travel and also halts at prime locations .
The Cruise took stop at places like Monte Carlo during F-1 racing which is a very expensive place to stay .
Thus it can be said that Stelios did venture into risks and tried new things in which he was successful .

If you to survive in the competitive world of today you need to try new things because there are large number of people who are goin to do the same old things that they know .
Venturing into risks is other major aspect of being successful .
You have to take calculated risks if you have to survive the competition .
For eg L N Mittal formerly the Chairman of Mittal Steel took a calculated risk by weighing his options and did a bid to take over another steel major Arcelor .
He did became successful in his venture and now runs the biggest Steel making company Arcelor Mittal .

So if you have to be successful in any field you would have to break the stereotype and find a path for yourself that you feel is going to make you successful

"I completely agree with the statement because what I personally believe is that in order to succeed , one has to keep on trying new things , explore the maximum one can in his/her domain and take measured risks .
Doing what one already knows certainly does not make the person successfull at all .

If a person keeps on doing what he or she already knows , a time comes when that person becomes bored and frustrated and calls for a change .
Moreover if he or she gets used to it , then they might have problems in migration .
Exploring new avenues is really the best way to succeed as this is the only way a person can compare the statistics of what he or she is doing over times with what has been done now .
Furthurmore , trying out new things helps in building up things and keeping the spirits and energy levels high as at each moment you are watching something new happening at your end .
Would like to mention about Late Kalpana Chawla , an artronaut , who used to work with NASA .
She is an inspiration for the people who want to succeed in life .
She was one of the crew members onboard Columbia which crashed a couple of years back .
The crew was supposed to perform 38 predetermined experiments , Kalpana was the only one onboared who took the initiative of performing some more research in biologocal environment , genetics , etc. and even after her death her work has been appreaciated .

Bill Gates , I 'm sure that everyone knows him .
He had a tendency to try out new things what others might not even think of .
His business involved so much of risk that a couple of big failures might have led him nowhere .
But still he kept going and today according to me he is the most successful person just because he tried out new things in his life and also he is probably the person who has had an enormous risk taking capacity .

Even if you fail while taking risks , you still would learn something new that would help you in developing an instinct that wouls be very helpful for you to be on the top of the world .
Just keep your spirits high .

"I would like to start by stating an old idiom ` Nothing succeeds like success` !
Which implies that if one suceeds in one field he is more likely to succeed in other fields also .
And I think it 's true and successful people do have better chance in in succeeding in new fields .

Firstly switching to any fild requires finance and funds at disposal .
And if one has succeeded in a particular field he would definitely be having savings or earning to take risks .
And eVen if they loose they have cushion behind them as they can again go back to the field in which their name has already been establishjed .
And to add to this when one has earned fame or goodwill in one field they can easily utilize that goodwill in other type of fields too .
we have many examples of well known actors switching to modelling and endorsing commercial brands .

The most important factor according to me is confidence .
Success brings confidence togeather with it and is the main factor that encourages the person to take risk and succeed .
Moreover a successful person is having experience which he can very well utilize to gain and reducing the probability of failiure .

This is true that one should not gamble in a field he is having less knowledge of but also one should not be adverse to risk , as risk and success are directly related .
one who is taking risk may or may not succeed , but one who does not try and take risk can never succeed .
And its quite obvious that a sucessful person can take risk with much less fear .

In the end I would like to conclude by saying ` RISK is not everyman 's GAME ' and a'A SUCCESSFUL PERSON IS THE ONE WHO TRYS NEW THINGS RATHER THAN STICKING TO ONE !

"`` Only people who venture into the Sea get the Pearl '' .
So goes an ancient Indian proverb .
And how true ?
I completely agree with the statement that success comes to those who take risks and do n't merely rest on past laurels .
I will present some explanations and examples to support my strong opinion about the issue .

If we stop and think about what will happen if all of us continue to do only the things we are sure of , or things we are best at ?
I shudder to think of such an eventuality .
The whole world would come to a grinding halt .
The world needs innovation and hunger in people to try on new things .
And the people who do that can be called the drivers of the world .
They are the leaders in the true sense .
For example had Gallileo not taken a stand about the earcth being round , had columbus not made that discovery that changed the world order .
What would the world be like ?
The constant need of change and trying on newer and better things may be risky but is certainly worthwhile .

Also in this fast changing world , if people however successful , stop trying new things and taking risks , they will soon find themselves not successful .
Businesses , scientists and governments , in other words all the people need to take risks just to survive .
You can keep on doing what you do best ; but in time you will realise that the thing you do no longer is good enough because the times have changed .

Moreover none of the inventions and discoveries were made without taking risk .
Currently popular management and business procedures were a risk when they were implemented for the first time .
We have only the people to thank who were brave enough to take up the challenge .
We need more such people if we continue our growth in almost any field .

Another important fact about risks and new things is the novelty value and the motivational effect .
New things and risks challenge people which is fodder for most successful people .
They crave for that challenge - they are challenged to out do themselves and this keeps the successful people going on .

Here goes a common joke on Bill Gates .
`` Bill Gates dropped out of school to create the Microsoft empire .
I can bet my last dollar on `` Had he continued in school , he would still be working in Microsoft - just owned by someone else '' .

This aptly concludes that success comes to those who are not averse to taking risks and constantly try newer things .

"I partially agree with the statement .
The human race is full of diversity & complexity , especially the human mind `` No two people think alike '' & this is a major cause of conflict between individuals in everyday life .
Thinking about the proverb :
`` Successful people dont do different things , they do things differently '' .
Being able to try new things , without pondering over the risk of failure , is indeed courageous , infact an innovation might seem precarious , but being able to work on it & trying to prove it to others , being able pursue people to accept it , is in itself a painstaking & tedious job .
It would definitely consume a lot of time , because , being able to convince others , when everyone thinks differently , is in itself a cumbersome task .

Yes , one might be successful in the long run , because no effort goes wasted , but one needs to have a lot of patience & perseverance .
For Example : trying to introduce a new drug in to the pharmaceutical industry is possible for a very diligent & patient person who is willing to carry out research , animal studies , clinical trials , approval from the FDA , then finally introduce the drug in the market , this can take up to several long years .

In the mean time several small industries might manufacture existing drugs after their patents expire , which is quicker , entails less risk , and ofcourse surity of the product sale , low cost .
Doing only what one already knows is definitely easier .
Doing things `` Differently '' might involve an enterpreneur who comes up with an extremely lucrative marketing strategy , but about marketing the same products , which were not doing too well initially , but suddenly have started doing great .
Here the person is very successful by not doing something different , but doing things `` Differently '' .

Success is not limited to few thoughts & strategies , but is a combination of various constructive thoughts & efforts , put forward by an individual or various individuals , to make things work in a constructive & productive way .

The definition of a successful person might not always be the one who is willing to try new things & take risks , but may also be the one who thinks of doing things he already knows in a more `` Innovative way '' & still be a huge success , for example : Donald Trump , who ventured in to real estate business , which is not something new , but not everyone who ventures in to real estate goes even close to Donald Trump , because `` he does things differently '' .

Ofcourse , the who knows how to take a `` calculated risk '' by making sure he doesnt suffer if the risk doesnt work in his favour , can definitely be successful .
So i partially agree with the above mentioned statement .

"Yes , personally I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Thats mainly because we all know how to do a some stuff well .
We are all special in something or another , it may be unique , but the fact that all of us are good at one thing is really - not unique .
Hence , if everyone does what they are good at it , they will be reasonable successful , but more very successful or famous .

People who like to try new stuff , who like to innovate or who try to take risks , are the ones who are daring enough to know that their ideas and plans might fail , but if they happen to go right - nothing stands between them and success .

Here , I would like to state the example of the Wright brothers - the ones who are the mastermind behind us flying from any destination of the world to another such destination .
Trains were common that day , travelling by ship and cars were also few of the more common and conventially traditional meens of transportation .
However , the Wright brothers had an idea , which was outlandish at that point , but if it clicked , they would have success at their feet , and the entire world would know them for that .
And thats precisely what they did .
They put that idea into practise .
Did their bit , and came out with a device that travels in air , and take u places in such short distances that were only dreamt of in that generation .

Thats why people who take risks , who have the courage to think out of the box and are willing to try their ideas because they have confidence in them .
By doing so , they take a chance of it failing or succeeding .
Fail , and the critics simply say `` we told you so .. '' , succeed , and everyone is astonished , and hails you - quite rightly so .

People only take risks because they have faith in their ideas and concepts .
People who have faith in their ideas and concepts are generally very intelligent and smart people , innovative people .
Hence they go ahead , take the risk , and bask in the glory if and when their ideas prevail and the entire world ( as in this case ) reaps the benefits of their courage , ideas and mainly - execution .

Therefore , I would like to conclude that yes , everyone can have a relative amount of success , but the ones who stand out for their success stories are the ones who take risks and try things which others do not dare dream off .

"Think of it if we would have had no internet facility and we would have send this response through a letter .
What would have been the turn around time ?
Its even hard to think of it .
Its because of few successful people that we are savoring all these facilities .
Human being is blessed with a mind power not to use it for things he is already aware of , but to try out different things so that he can help others with it .
People who try out new and different things are better known in this world compare to the ones who have been amongst the common ones .
Successful people differ from others in different perspectives like courage , approach and many more .

First lets take an example of Sachin Tendulkar , the youngest player in the history of international cricket .
If he would have assumed that a person can only be a part of country team only at adult age .
Then his name would not have been written in history .
With his courage and strength he gained the major place in world .
Its his different styles of batting that make him stand different from others .
Otherwise he would have been like other common players .
There are many others and few of them are Abraham Lincoln , Mahatma Gandhi who were known for their courage and stood against the governing bodies to bring in the change for all .

Second , think if Einstein would not have come up with those innovations .
Had it been easy for men now to relate different things which are made easy now , with those laws .
If he would have stopped because of his continuous failures and would not have taken another risk then people would have been deprived of another innovation .
Its the approach and abilty to take risks that counts the most in this world and makes one successful and distinguish person .

How many know us ?
Well very few untill and unless we come up with few distinguish ideas or achievements that make us stand different from others .
This is the reason why the Researchers or Specialists are given high positions in the society .
Its not becuase they have different degrees attached to their names , its because of the innovations and their capability to try out new and different things .

"It is said that the only thing which does not change , is the change itself .
With the passage of time everybody has to change .
Change is consider to be natural phenomonen .
For example , a new born baby is changed to a boy , then into an adult and finally into a old man .

Therefore , i agree that `` successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .

It can be observed that the organisation which did not change with the changing time got out of the business in no time .
Take the example of the pager compnies .
They did not anticipated the change in technology and had to perish .
It is important to do what you really know how to do well , but it should be taken care off wether or not that particular thing hold relevence to you or your organisation anymore .
One of the example here can be of IBM , which recently sold off its computer division to Lenovo , a chinese company , because it realisede that its main area of concern is the business solutions .
The acceptence of this change can be gauged from the fact that in the year 2006 , the mergers and aquisitions to diversify the business and to explore new ares were to the tune of 4 trillion US dollers worldwide .

One of the main reason why people are afraid of trying new things is the fear of failure , But that fear should be put behind if a person or a company wants to grow .
One of the Indian example to me mind relating this is of Bajaj Automobile Limited .
( A two weeler manufacturing company in India ) .
Bajaj was known for his scooters for quiet a long time .
My father used to tell me that there were hage queues of the customers to buy a bajaj scooter .
But latley bajaj realised that mobikes is the new buzz word of the Indian market and imideately directed its focus to manufacture motercycles and launched Pulsar , which is a huge success in the Indian market .

"Yes i agree with the statemen , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' as people gain success they experiment with new ideas and takes risks of implementing those ideas .
The main purpose of this experiment is to increase their growth and success in fields other than what they already know perfectly .

For most of the successful people success is not the only goal , but their goal is an increase in success with the passing time .
I think risks must be taken so as to explore other fields inorder to achieve success .
Success of an individual depends mainly on his self confidence and his skills in adapting what he dont know .

Trying out something is the basic step of attaining success or failure .
Only after trying out something that is new people are directed towards success or failure and in case of success people try to expertise themselves in that particular field and later on try for some new things to add on to their success .

An organization which is successful in providing people with a soft drink of a particular flavour will later on take a risk of trying out something new by introducing a new drink , if it fails then the drink may be withdrawn from the market but in case of success the gain a huge business and sales .

Success it attained by dedication , hardwork and skills , a successful person feels independent and keeps on trying new paths or ideas to increase their success .
But people who dont try new ideas maintain the same position at which they are present since a long time .

Success is achieved by taking riks and implying new ideas , new ideas are helpful steps and a right path for people who are successful .

"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things instead of doing what they already know how to do well .
In today 's changing and competitive world , people who are not willing to try new innovative things will get left behind .
I cite the example of Microsoft Corporation as a company that has thrived because they were willing to take risks .
They took a contract to develop an operating system for IBM even when they had no product in hand .
After signing the contract , they found the appropriate piece of software called DOS , and developed it sufficiently to meet all the contract requrements of IBM .
If they had not taken that risk , who knows where that company would have been today .
They contrinued to take enormous monetary and other risks to develop all their subsequent products , especially MS Word , even when other word processing products like Word Perfect were more popular at the time .
By showing a desire to change and try new methods , Microsoft has reached the pinnacle of its glory in the PC business .
My personal experience in the field of engineering has led me to similar conclusions .
Our company stayed around 60 employees and grew at a 2-3 % growth rate for the 1st 35 years of existence .
However , the advent of another CEO changed the fortunes of the company .
After about 10 years since he took over , we now have about 400 employees and have more than quadrupled our revenue .
This happened because the new CEO expanded the business into other areas deemed risky like telecommunication , water resources and control solutions .
He even opened a `` build '' component to the original `` design '' organization , which was very risky because of many unknowns .
The `` build '' component of the company proved to be the biggest revenue grosser at the company .
Hence , because of the two examples provided above , I am convinced that most successful people try new things instead of just doing things they already know .
They may not always succeed , but as the saying goes , bigger the risk , bigger the benefit .

"Most of the people are happy with the knowledge they have or say they are unconcerned about new topics , while some other type of people , have an appetite to do new things that is try out new things .
My type of category is the second one , So i would go with and agree to the statement - `` Succesfull people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well. '' for their insatiable curiosity , always active and open , risk involved .

Unquenchable curiosity is the driving force behind all the successfull people .
It is this force which keeps them engaged in their work .
As for example , let us consider an scientist .
He is a person always wanting to know how thing work , what will happen next , what would be the response if i do it that way - are some of the question arousing in minds of these mens .
Thomas alva edison is one of the most succesfull scientist & a men with these virtues .
He experimented with around 1200 ideas , and finally invented the electric bulb .
It was this appetite for inventing , rather say doing things differently from rest of the mass made him a successfull person .

Always active and open to ideas is an another attribute of the wise .
They clasp or hug new ideas with open arms .
Isaac newton can be a considered to be a part of this species .
Everyone saw apple falling but only newton was the one to cast doubts by thinking `` why that apple fell . ''

By taking calculated risk they take their bussiness , principles to peak or pass off as an forlorn entity .
A whole lot of people get success by trying out new things differently and innovating an already active idea .
Some of the ingredients of these kind of people is their curiosity towards their work , their open mind and the ability to take risk .
To be successful in life , a person has to be : keen towards his work , open to different views by different peoples and the ability to take some good risk ...

"I aree only partially with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they do well .
Although , trying newer things keeps up the growth graph and helps a person to rise above the rest but equally true is the fact that one can be equally successful in some thing in which he or she has both , experience and expertise .

To excel in any field , its extemely crucial to know ones job correctly and efficiently .
This excellence can be achieved by hard work and spending more time on the job at hand .
In other words , experience and diligence is the key to success .
For this reason , I belive that those people who do the same thing over a long period of time or do it well , do become successful .
For example , a mechanic specializing in repairing electronic gadgets can achieve enough success even if he sticks to that very job forever .
People shall always trust him more than the neophytes in the profession .
However , if he changes his job or tries to multitask in more number of jobs , he might end up spoiling his established work and not even getting the customer 's support in the new area in which he will now become a beginner .

However , trying out different things in life cannot be seen with any contempt .
It is always said that if you stop growing , you would soon start declining .
Staying in just one thing and doing nothing else can easily stagnate a person and stagnant water is worth nothing more than a breeding place for mosquitoes and deadly diseases .
Therefore , it is as proper to keep experimenting in life .
One should always learn newer and better stuff and become adroit in them .
At the same time , one must never forget to keep in touch with the original talent and maintain it .

Conclusively , Whether you decide to stay in your discipline , or diversify , success can be all yours , provided , you do it with sincerity and hardwork .

"I agree with the statement that successful people try innovative methods / things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I would like to explain the reasons for my agreement with the statement with the help of a few examples .

I believe that most successful people have proved to the world and to themself that they are capable individuals .
Therefore , only if they do some thing different and innovative , it would give them pleasure .
As per Mr. A. Maslow 's motivation theory , these individuals have reached the final motivation stage of `` Self-Acculization '' , hence only self-pride motivate them .

I would like to give the example of Mr. Sunil Mittal ( Chairman of Bharti Telecommunications ) and Mr. Anil Ambani ( Chairman of Anil Dhirubhia Ambani Group ) .

Mr. Mittal is the chairman of one of India 's largest mobile tele-communication companies , which controls almost 30 % market share in the GSM network in India .
Recently , Mr. Mittal has announced a plan to setup a `` organized retail venture '' in partnership with Walmart .
Retail and Tele-communications are very diverse sectors , but Mr. Mittal is keen to enter into the organized retail space in India for marketing consumer products .
This shows that a person who owns and operates one of the largest companies in India is ready to explore unchartered territory to take on a new challenge .

Mr. Anil Ambani is the chairman of one of the most reputed groups in India .
Officially , he is ranked among the richest men ( top five ) in India .
He has started an organization of acquiring secured debts / loans of distressed companies In India .
He plans to turnaround make profits by acquiring the liabilities of these companies at nominal value and then by selling the companies to strategic players operating in the same industry as the distressed player .
This business line is completely different from what the group already does .

Therefore , I strongly believe that successful people try new things and take on risks rather than do what they are already good at .
",P8,HIN,high,0
"I believe that it is not necessary that successful people try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .

For me , success is an absolute term .
It cannot be defined by some standards like having money or a high position in job .
Success is what you feel it is .
For some people success may be to lead a peaceful life with family and friends while sharing whatever you have .
So in that terms a person may be successful by just doing whatever he knows to do well .

On the other hand , those who try new things and take risks may not be successful .
Taking risks has both pros and cons .
One may achieve a lot and at the same time there is a possibility that he may lose everything he has , while a person who does whatever he knows well is sure to keep doing that part and be content .
In taking risks and trying new things , until you succeed you have the fear of losing .
You put not only your happiness and well being at stake , but also of those who are dependent on you for their happiness .

A person trying to do new things has to devote a lot of time researching the options , finding the best opportunity or creating one and then working on it .
If he devotes the same time in doing what he already knows , he can spare some time for pleasure and fun .
There are no statistics to prove that conservatives ( who do not take risks ) are less successful as compared to aggresives ( who take risks ) .

Risk averse and risk tolerant attitudes are also reflective of a culture or background .
Again , there are no reports that show that people who took risks and tried new things were the only ones to succeed .
e.g. Mother Teresa is a successful personality .
She did social work which she new well and kept doing it till the end of her life .
Similarly there are examples of people who gamble with the view of taking risk and trying to be successful , but lose everything .

In conclusion , I would say that if for me success is to be happy and satisfied in life and I am happy and satisfied while doing whatever I know to do well , then I am a successful person .

"Humans are curious by nature .
We tend to know more and explore the areas which we are unsure about .
Curosity in turn , causes new invention and thus improves our living style as we can see in the case of developing technology .
In my opinion , risks are a part of new inventions and it helps us knowing more about the unresolved mysteries that exists like the part of neuroscience still under development .

Risks open new path for developments .
People working for NASA , take several risks of trying out new things which were never tried before .
landing on moons , launching rockets with human beings in it to get an exact picture of space .
NASA is at its peak of success and it 's much more because of its ability to try out new things .

Trying out new things add adventure to life .
Without taking any sort of risks life would be like a stagnant pool of water with steady results or rather no change in the usual life style .
Risks are a little dangerous as the word itself might suggest but it does open up new dimensions for human to work on and explore more .

Risks are not to be scared from .
If taken in limited and sensible amounts , it will have more positive effects than negative .
NASA does n't take a step without a scientific background to the information it works on .
They calculate and prepare for the worst and achieve succesful results exploring new facts about space science .

There is a well known saying called , `` No risks , no gain . ''

"As the maxim stands `` Nothing succeeds like success '' , holds true in either case , whether an individual takes risk and becomes successful or he does not take risk and still turns out out to be successful .
In my opinion , success is about taking risks and rather than only doing what they already know .
Thus , I agree to the given statement .

In my opinion people do become successful even when they adopt the old opinion but by doing that , ther are not the leaders in the society but followers .
For example , a company X opened chain resturants and decided to franchise its resturants .
The company X was successfull .
Company Y decides to follow the the foot prints of Company X and did not try anything different .
Company Y may be successful in the long run but may not a leader while as company X is a leader and other organisations will follow him .
Same is true with the individuals .

Secondly , by not taking risks , people always live in shells .
They lack creativity to do some thing different and their potential as an individual is not absolutely harnassed .
Take the example of director Steven Speilsberg .
When he was working on his movie `` Titanic '' , most people though he was doing impossible and would not succeed .
We all know what happened after that .

Changes in any field are inevitable .
An individual who is stuck to his old thoughts and do only that what he / she knows , may not respond in an optimum way when changes warrant different .
The individual may not be able to cope to the changes and thus may turn out to be a failure .

Last but not the least , the success involved in trying new things and taking risk is fast .
An individual may be successful in trying only what they already know but it may involve lot of time .
If the individual wants the output to be positive and quick , he may need to take risk at any stage of life .

To conclude , risk taking ability is an essential quality of an individual to succeed .
Howver , he or she should not get carried away with the amount of risk one is taking .
They should measure the risk benefit ratio before taking risk and thus finally decide if it is worth it to take the risk to be successful .

"The issue of to be successful , whether people should try new things and take risks or do what they already know , is a controversial one .
On the one hand , by doing what one knows well , the results of the actions are predictable and the methods are probably already proven .
On the other hand , risk taking and tyring new things opens new and unexplored avenues to success which one could never have imagined .
On final analysis , I belive trying new things and taking risks is more rewarding and brings about more success than doing what one already knows .

Successful people have always looked to the new ways to success , which were not necessarily the areas that they were experts in .
These people venture into doing new things , learning a great deal in the processs , and then end up creating a new path to success .
Microsoft Corporation is one such example of one such creation .
Created by a group of people , who belived in something new , in a time when the term ` software ' was known only to a handful .
Today , that belief held by that group of people has given us a software that has changed the way our life functions .

Inventions and breakthroughs did not happen because of people who did what they did well .
It happened because of people who moved out of their comfort zone , confroned norms , broke shakles , to prove a point .
And have these people been successful ?
Most certainly so .
Right from Albert Einstein to Micheal Dell of Dell Computers .

The argument in favor of doing what one does well is that one can predict the results , be assured of a short term success and then claim to be successful .
But to achieve the next level of success , one needs to go further and foray into territories which are less trodden than others .

according to me successful people are those poeple who willing to take risks and are ever ready to try new things .
according to me risk equals reward and the more risk you take the better will be your reward .
when a person tries a new venture he does not know what the outcome would be and therefore he works extremely hard in order to make it function properly .

"I completely agree to the statement and I strongly believe that in order to succeed one should be willing to take chances/risks in life and try unexplored avenues .
I 'd like to support my statement by mentioning following points and examples :
Firstly , as we all know that we have to live once and as some people say that life is not a rehearsal , I think we have been given just one opportunity to explore different avenues of life .
Indeed life would become very monotonous and boring if risks/chances are not taken and novel things are not tried .
Having said that it should be taken into consideration that the chance taken should not harm oneself or others .
For instance , if we think of the big names of business world like Bill gates and Sushil Mittal , they could not have achieved their current status , if they would n't have taken risks in their lives .
These people were not well acquainted with computers and steel , respectively when they started but because of their willingness to explore and take chance they undoubteldy succeed and reached to the highest level .

Secondly , I believe that if risks/chances are not taken in most of the areas , it would definitely affect the rate at which we invent newer technologies today .
Most of the advances are based on assumptions that one would succeed while attempting a particular task .
For example , momentous discoveries like computer , internet , telescope , etc. would not have been possible without taking the risk and considering the possiblity of failures .

Thirdly , I feel that one should be concious of that fact while taking risks/chances that success is not always a surity becasue we always do not get what we aim for .
So it 's not essentially true that people who took chances earlier are only successful ones , but there are people who were unable to achieve what they desired despite of taking risks .

Finally , I conclude that though there is no harm in working on only doing something that a person knows well , but i think that would make life very stagnant and our advancement will be badly hampered .
So a person should always be willing to lookout for opportunites and take calculated risks in his life and sooner or later he would definitely taste success .

"As soon as a child begins schooling he/she is taught to be creative , to think out of box , rather be unconventional at times , challenge the existing dogmas .
Perhaps these are the virtues that have helped mankind in the development of the world today .
These are also reflected in successful people .
They try new things , take risks and this is what makes them successful and different from the common man and perhaps I fully support the statement .

Imagine if people did not try new things and take risks , then would and new metal or perhaps discoveries by Madam Curie be possible .
Would America be discovered by columbus if he did not take the risk to venture out on a round the world trip .
Would we know of legends like Hercules , Achilles or Alexander if they did not take the risk of conquering the world .
Perhaps even today we would have thought that the earth is flat and not round , earth is the center of the universe and may be we would still be writing on leaves instead of paper .

Sucess cannot be quantified and what is success to one might be just an ordinary achievement for other .
To this critics might say that you should do your work with proper thought and achieve mastery in one expertise rather than be a master of all .
This what they would say that `` You should work on only what you know rather than take risks and try new things '' .
But in my opinion the answer to this is that , Would `` Microsoft '' be there where it is today if `` Bill Gates '' had not taken the risk and tried to be unconventional rather be submissive .
Also if we take the example of the field of medicine , then perhaps new discoveries would rather be impossible .
If our doctors had not taken the risk involved in organ transplantation , cancer research , or may be stem cell research then perhaps many people would have not been here today as they are because of them .

To this I may add that being foolhardy is also not advisable .
You should take risks only when you know that there is an element of success there .
Just trying to show off will not land you anywhere .
Therefore if i were to conclude then perhaps to be successfull you will have to try new things and be courageous to take risks but only when it is advisable and needed .
Imitating others might give you momentary success or may be even more but not the recognition wherein you will be remembered for something new .

"Success is another way of expressing an achievment and successful people are known by their achievments .
Nothing can be cosidered worth a success unless certain risk fator is involved in it .
Hence I agree that successful people are what they are because they have dared new things and have taken risks rather than doing things already known .
History of mankind is studded with unimaginable achievments to justify this aspect .

The most daring and risky act , according to me , is discovery of America .
Though the purpose was different , i.e. finding a new sea route to India , Columbus dared to dream of embariking on a journey which was considered impossible .
His success is not discovering America but to have dared to go on a journey to the unknown worlds through neverending oceans .
Had he tried to follow same routes to India , probably he would have become another rich business man but no the Columbus we admire .

Sometimes the risk taken by a successful person speaks more than his achievements .
In a survey conducted by a business school of Arizona in the late 90's it was observed that out of every ten businessmen eight had adopted newer methods and undertook risky tasks to reach the their position .
Many successful people belive that there is not much use `` inventing the wheel again '' when you have so much to do in the areas which are not yet ventured into .

I consider that when we do something it should involve some novality in it .
Because without any novality , what ever we do , it will not have life .
And one should always be prepared to take risks because as it is said `` when going gets tough the tough gets going '' .
And it is the tough which succeeds .

"I firmly believe that it is more beneficial to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject. Having a diverse range of knowledge across various disciplines can lead to a well-rounded understanding of the world and foster critical thinking skills. 

Firstly, having a broad knowledge base allows individuals to make connections between different subjects, leading to innovative ideas and solutions. For example, a person who has knowledge in both biology and engineering may be able to contribute valuable insights to the field of medical technology by combining principles from both disciplines.

Furthermore, a broad knowledge base can also make individuals more adaptable in an ever-changing world. With the rapid pace of technological advancements and societal shifts, having a diverse skill set can make it easier to pivot and succeed in different areas.

Lastly, having a broad knowledge base can lead to a more fulfilling intellectual life. Engaging with a variety of subjects can spark curiosity and passion, leading to a more enriching and fulfilling academic journey.

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can lead to a more versatile, adaptable, and intellectually fulfilling life.",P1,SPA,high,1
"In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, the debate between having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one specific subject is a topic of much discussion. While both approaches have their merits, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many subjects is more beneficial in the long run.

Having a broad knowledge base allows individuals to adapt to various situations and challenges more effectively. For instance, someone with a broad understanding of different subjects like science, humanities, and business can approach problems from multiple perspectives, leading to more innovative solutions. This interdisciplinary approach fosters creativity and critical thinking skills, which are essential in today's complex and ever-changing world.

Furthermore, a broad knowledge base can open up more opportunities for personal and professional growth. It allows individuals to explore different interests and passions, leading to a more fulfilling and well-rounded life. For example, someone with knowledge in various subjects can easily transition between different career paths or pursue multiple interests simultaneously.

While specialization in a specific subject can lead to expertise in that particular field, it can also limit one's perspective and ability to adapt to new challenges. In contrast, having a broad knowledge of many subjects provides a solid foundation that can be applied across various disciplines and situations.

In conclusion, while specialization has its place, the benefits of having a broad knowledge base of many academic subjects outweigh the advantages of focusing solely on one specific subject. Embracing diversity in learning not only enhances personal growth but also equips individuals with the adaptability and creativity needed to thrive in today's rapidly changing world.",P1,SPA,high,1

Similarly, a professional with a broad knowledge base may be more adaptable to changes in the job market, as they can apply their skills across different industries.

In conclusion, while specialization is essential in certain fields, having a broad knowledge of various academic subjects can provide individuals with a competitive edge in today's complex and rapidly evolving world. It enables them to approach problems from multiple angles and adapt to diverse situations, ultimately leading to greater success and fulfillment.",P1,SPA,high,1
"In considering whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject, I believe that both approaches have their own merits depending on an individual's goals and aspirations. However, in a rapidly evolving world where interdisciplinary skills are increasingly valued, having a broad knowledge base can offer more advantages.

Firstly, a broad knowledge of multiple academic subjects can foster a well-rounded understanding of the world, enabling individuals to make connections across different disciplines and think critically. This interdisciplinary approach can lead to innovative solutions and a more holistic perspective on complex issues.

Furthermore, having a broad knowledge base can provide individuals with greater adaptability and versatility in various professional settings. In today's dynamic job market, employers often seek candidates who can demonstrate a range of skills and knowledge, making a diverse academic background highly valuable.

On the other hand, specialization in a specific subject can lead to deep expertise and mastery in a particular field, which can be advantageous for individuals pursuing careers that require specialized knowledge, such as medicine or engineering.

In conclusion, while specialization has its benefits, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can offer individuals a more versatile skill set, enhanced critical thinking abilities, and greater adaptability in an increasingly interconnected world.",P1,SPA,high,1
"In today's fast-paced world, the debate between having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one specific subject is ongoing. While specialization can lead to expertise in a particular field, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many subjects outweighs the benefits of specialization.

Having a broad knowledge base allows individuals to adapt to different situations and challenges. For example, a person with a broad understanding of various subjects like history, science, and literature can draw connections between seemingly unrelated topics, leading to creative problem-solving and innovative ideas. This interdisciplinary approach can be beneficial in today's interconnected world, where complex issues often require a multifaceted understanding.

Moreover, having a broad knowledge base can also lead to personal growth and development. By exploring various subjects, individuals can discover new interests and passions, leading to a more fulfilling and well-rounded life. For instance, someone who initially specialized in biology may find joy in learning about art history, enriching their life experiences and perspectives.

In conclusion, while specialization is crucial in certain fields, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous in today's dynamic and interconnected world. It fosters adaptability, creativity, and personal growth, ultimately leading to a more enriched and fulfilling life.",P1,SPA,high,1
"Life is not a one subject thing .
As I learned during my high school , we need to have a broad knowledge , to see things as a whole .
In life everything is a consequence , interrealtions between different areas of knowledge .
You shouldnt limit yourself to one area .

I studied in an Interdisciplinary program , which has as main objective to see knowledge as a whole by making conections between differents subjects having as main axe History .
I found it so much more interesting this way .
You can understand why things happened , per example the relation between music , art and war in the second half of the XX century .
If you see each of this areas alone , you will have an incomplete version , because you are taking the situations out of their context .

Also if you focalize your stuides in only one area .
You are limitating your vision of the world .
Because there is no point in knowing everything about one topic .
You will be missing so many things .
In my case , I like more than one subject .
I dont want to choose only one .
Why are we forced to specialize in one subject , if at the end we will need more than one .
Thats why i decided to follow a university carreer in which i can choose any class that i like , regardless the area .

Another example of why we should know about several knowledge branches , is when we interact with people , per example in a dinner .
A person who only knows about one topic will be bored .
But if everyone knows a little about different areas , they can have an interesting conversation in which everyone can interact and discuss .
Touching different topics avoiding monotomy .

I believe you need all types of knowledge per example Math , that is one of the subjects that is usually disliked .
If you go to the supermarket you need to know to make sums , to at least be able to make the numbers .
You will face huge difficulties in life if you dont know at least something from every subject .

I believe everyone should be able to have a conversation in more than one topic .
I believe that only the difference will help you broad your mind .
And making connections helps to understand life better so you will never get bored .

"Is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ?
Or is it better to specialize in one specific subject ?
Tricky questions .
I would have to say that it depends , they both have their cons and pros .
For example , when you 're in high school , which is my case , you definitely should have knowledge of all the academic subjects that you need in order to graduate and pass on to your next step in life , which is college .
But once you get to college , for example , why would you need to know advanced math when you do n't want to study anything related to it ?
You would just be wasting your time and money .

Right now , I 'm required to know , at least a little , about everything , from ancient history to the meaning of the mathematical term pi .
But sometimes I find myself asking : will I ever use this again in my life ?
Why should I learn all these things if I do n't want to study anything related to it ?
But then there are some other times when , for example , my younger sister comes to me with a school problem and I can help her because I 've learned those things before .

Sometimes we can be very lazy and only learn what is presented to us at the moment .
But then there are the times when we want to know everything .
Like for example , when we are kids , that everything our mothers do we question them why .
Why this and why that , and there never seems to be an answer to all of a our questions .

Going back to the questions , a pro of knowing about different subjects is that you actually know about pretty much anything .
This makes it easier to have a conversation with another person and even to get a boyfriend .
A con is that maybe you 've spend way too much time doing your research and when you realize it a part of your life has gone by .
A pro of specializing in only one specific subjetc is that you can be better at what you do .
A con is that you wo n't have so many things to talk about with someone outside of what you do .

To summarize this entire thing , I definetely think that everyone should have knowledge of basic information and subjects and even read the newspaper , at least once in a while , and be educated , but have more knowledge on your field of study and that way you can be the best professional that you can be .

"In the first place I am the kind of person who likes to know about different themes and academic subjects , but I think that is better to concentrate in one specific subject because you are not going to be able to have a deep knowledge in many subjects .
I believe that is better to concentrate your knowledge .

Some people may think that is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects .
This idea could be true but I am sure that less is more .
For example if you are studying something realated with the arts like graphic design or filmmaking .
In thouse fields of study you have a wide varaiety of subjects to study and learn , but then you have to choose and concentrate in one subject or theme .
For example in filmmaking you can choose between different fields of study like Producction Design , Direction of photography , Editing , Screenwriting or Directing .
Even if you have a lot of subjects in common then you need to specialize in one subject .
For example if you want to be a film director you need to cover and know about different themes and subjects like painting , art , literature , lighting .
But this does n't mean that you need to have a deep knowledge in all those things .
Those things are going to help you to understand about how things work but I believe that you do n't need to be able to handle the lighting for example .

Finally I think that life is to short to have broad knowledge in many things .
I prefer to concentrate in the things i enjoy and know about them

"Historically , people have aquired knowledge in a broad general way while they are young and are growing up , and that knowledge usually narrows down to something more specific when high school ends and college begins .

Some people think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects while other people believe that one should specialize in one specific subject .
In my view , attaining knowledge of various academic subjects makes for a more disperse and unfocused way of life .

Firstly , learning about many things is something that comes naturally in life .
As we live our every day experiences we learn different things , but in contrast , what we choose to follow as a career should be the unique subject that interests us the most to a point of dedicating a great part of our lives to it .

During our academic years where we learn about a trade or a specific way something is done which we will then apply in real life to better our way of living , get the things we want for ourselves or create new systems for the future in the society we live in , we should strictly stick to one subject with its adjacent issues and not to many academic subjects that would make us loose focus and in the end not relate to anything at all .

Secondly , Learning about only one subject will make us waist a lot less energy , thus making us advance at a quicker pace towards our goals and not making us loose interest on the way .

Moreover , there are very few people in history who have dedicated their lives to many things , like for example Leonardo Da Vinci , who was an overall inventor , artist , investigator and doctor , but we can also say that he was really a eye-opener in a time where people needed to know and discover many things about the world they lived in .

Nowadays , with the Internet and what has become a visual era where the senses are constantly bombarded with information about our environment and the world we live in , the more important it is that we stey focused on one thing at a time instead of many .

In conclusion , I think it is much better to specialize in one specific academic subject than many different ones because it makes one concentrate more on what is personally important and therefore lets one view what is around in a different and better way .

"It has always been in debate whether having a broad knowledge of many academics subject is better than being specialize in one specific subject .
There have been many good reasons for both sides and in conclusion it is a only a matter of opinion .
In my opinion , I believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many things than be specialized in one subject Firstly , if one has a broad knowledge of many things because one is more aware of his surroundings .
Know a little about a lot makes you more cultured since you can discuss and converse on different topics even if you are not specialized in one .
You also are not puzzled by simple questions that many specialized people would n't be able to answer outside their subject of knowledge .
If you are with a person that only knows about one subject , his field of conversation is much smaller than one that has some knowledge about many topics .

Secondly , being specialized in one subject never means that you know everything there is to know about the topic because there will always be questions .
Socrates said , `` I know that I know nothing '' .
Einstein also said that the more one knows , the more he understands the little knowledge he has .
These two great people in history are commenting on what is problemetic of specialized knowledge .
Once you dig deeper in a subject more problems will always apear .
Once you know one more fact in the sobject , two more questions will arise .

Finally , to have success in the future , at work or in life , one will eventually use more that the knowledge of one subject .
One will impliment the vast knowledge he has to solve the obstacles ahead of him .
Maybe you are a great mathematician but know nothing of psychology , you will have a hard time going through life with just being an expert in that subject .
Math will not help you when you are trying to raise a family or looking after children .
There must be a balance of esencial knowledge that people must have In my opinion , to be succesful in life and be able to handle the obstacles in it one must have an all-around knowledge of many esencial instruments that will be used later on .
You will sacrifice deep knowledge about subjects but gain much more in life .
Life does n't come in subjects , in comes in a whole .

"It is essential to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects in order to specialize in one specific subject .
Once an indivudual has accquired a reasonable amount of knowledge on different academic subjects , concentrating on a specific area of interest can be estremely beneficial .

A teenager that wants to study medicine has to complete four to five years of med-school in order to specialize on a specific area of medicine .
This is simply an example which can be applied to any other career choice in order to demonstrate the importance of a how general knowledge and common sense contribute to the success of any professional .

When someone concentrates all their attention on a specific subject , he is creating a social barrier for himself .
This social barrier consists on the following : when attending a social event , the communication this individual will have will be limited to his specific subject of interest .
He/she will not be able to have great imput in a conversation between the people present because he/she will be focused on another subject most of the time .

When attending college , this changes .
In my opinion , it is ideal to take one or two years of basic studies or liberal arts in order to have a strong base and be successful the following years .
On the other hand , any professional that wants to be prosperous in his career , will have to , at one point or another , focus most of his attention on his major or profession .
This does not mean that he/she will have to alienate himself from the world in order to do so .

"In my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
This is because a person with a general knowlegde of many subjects is usually more prepared for a lot of things in life than a person that knows perfectly everything about a single subject .

I believe that a person who knows about things like science , math , history and art for example is much more prepared for living in our nowadays society than a person who knows only about cooking lets say .
There can be a man who is the best chef in the world , he can be very succesfull in what he does , but how usefull can it be to know how to make the a wonderful birthday cake when you do n't know how to divide it in exact pieces for everyone ?
or how would he know what food is good or bad for human beings ?
or how would he know how to advertize his food ?
how to manage and create a restaurant ?
These and so many other reasons are why it is important to have at least a little bit of knowledge in many subjects .

Also for personal satisfaction , I think it is important to know about different subjects .
I believe a person always feels better when they know more .
I certainly believe that a someone who knows everything there is to know about a subject , like cooking , also feels pretty good ; but going to back to the chef example , how would he feel if he goes to a dinner with all his friends and they start talking about history or politics or world affairs ?
In my opinion he would rather stay home next time and only meet his friends when they want to eat his wonderful dishes .
I think being ignorant in a lot of things can create a low self-asteem for many people , even if they believe they are the best in ONE single subject .

In conclusion , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one because it does n't only help us with our daily lives but it also gives us a personal satisfaction , because we know about more than one thing .

"Broad knowledge on all the areas of knowing allows an individual to have intellect over many subjects , which are the academic subjects .
Primary and Secondary schools provide a person with the basic knowledge of all the areas concerning academic subjects .
However , when the individual enters an university level of education , the person starts to focus on a specific area , still making reference to others , but refering and specialazing in one area .
I believe that even though this focus on an area allows an individuals to develop a career on that topic where the individual 's interest is ; a broad knowledge of all academic subjects is fundamental and neccesary for the development and growth of the individual throughout its life .
Some of the areas of knowledge are the following : math , history , social sciences , natural sciences , and the arts ( literature , music , and plastic arts ) .
For an individual to entirely comprehend world conflicts and life situations it is demanded an atleast a general comprehension of these subjects .

Besides the knowledge of all these academics areas enhance the comprehension of the individual towards life , it permits the creation of connections between events through reason between them and to contribute more to the society .

Someone does not need to be an historian or an artist to comprehend these areas , but a basic knowledge on these amiliorate any difficulty in understanding them .
As a preceptor , the individual has to make use of reason and logic to make those conneccions which allow to understand , and also to create their own theories , their own conclusions regarding a topic .

Academic subjects are the tools given to individuals to have the start , the spark to create and make up its own criteria towards and subject , also the ability to discuss among a group of persons a topic and have basis to take and defend a stand .

For example , those members that work in the United Nations must have hollistic knowledge of the happenings of the world and must have the ability of recognize them , and to use all the areas of knowledge , along with the ways of knowing , to find possible solutions through the making of resolutions .
Even though there are the committes of human rights , E.C.O.S.O.C , disarmament and enviroment ; each member of this committe cant be stuck on only one of the subjects involved .
When looking to a conflict each one of them has to have the ability to look at the panoramic view , denominated the birds view , from that of the narrow view , the ants view .
This is what separates us from animals , the ability to reason , to identify a problem and search for a solution , using our most valuable tool which is our knowledge .

In conclusion , to have a better comprehension of the world , of conflicts , of life the individual must have a broad knowledge of all the acaemic topics , because they are all interrelated , and this builds up the persons own personal criteria towards anything , this makes it possible for discussions between U.N. memebers concerning possible solutions towards the impovement of a better world .

"In my oppinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Personally , I like to know all about a specific subject because in most of the cases it is the only way to understand the real truth .
This real truth would not be achieved if one do not get to the core of the subject in hand .

Futhermore , I think that not only specialization is desirable and necesary for science to advance but also broad knowledge is the reason why during several centuries there has been so few cientific discoveries .
An example could be that as scientists specialized in certain areas and subjects , they started to make astonishing discoveries that revolutionized humankind .

Also , because I am an economist , I feel urged to know everything about a certain subject in order to be able to find the correct solution for the problem I am working on .
For example , I would not be able to explain the reason for the high inflation rates that occured during the last decade in Argentina unless I get deep knowledge about the causes of inflation .
In that example it is clear that a broad knowledge about Argentina , or even argentinean economy , would not be enough .

On the other hand , it should be said that certain disciplines such as philosophy need people who have broad knowledge about many subjects in order to be able to move forward and have a profund impact in society .
\ In summary , I think that specialization is the key to knowledge for most sciences beacuse it allows the scientist to gain a good insight about all it matters about his area of study .

"Whether having broad knowledge of many topics is better than specializing in an specific one is not an easy question , and often , not even our choice , since it 's determined by our education .
Even though it 's an issue applicable to all fields in life , I 'll narrow it down to a professional point of view , and how being a very specialized person can be very positive at work , but can also significantly damage your career path .

The best way to start the discussion is by illustrating the issue with an example which I 'm relatively familiar with .
There are many companies currently developing new mobile phone networks , which results in an enormous investment in highly qualify telecom engineers .
The market value of an experienced engineer in `` 3G '' network deployment can be measured in terms of hundreds of thousands of dollars .
The learning and development opportunities , as well as the earning potential , are very attractive .

On the other hand , there are other telecom professionals who rather have a slower progression by broadening their knowledge .
`` In order to be prepared for the future changes , it 's better to know a bit of everything '' , would be their milestone .
They may not be so successful in 3 years time , but when the development of the new technology starts to die off , the knowledge and expertise they 've acquired in other fields will open them doors that wo n't be available for those who specialised in that one specific subject , which is no longer `` fashionable '' .

These advantages and drawbacks can be extended to all aspects of life .
A case that will sound familiar to everyone is that smart member of our family who can talk about everything , but when you ask him for deeper detail on certain topic , can only give vague responses .
This is one of many examples that can be found in real life .

As I said at the beginning , having a very broad range of knowledge is often dictated by our education to a certain extent ; but we 'll always have the option to specialize in a more specific topic , or guide our knowledge to a more open and general approach , by spending as long as we possibly can studying about it .

"TO KNOW AND HOW MUCH TO KNOW , THAT IS THE QUESTION

I always define my generation as based on the lyrics of a Brazilian pop song of the 80s which said , `` I know a little about almost everything , and almost everything I know badly '' .
On my day and age , a popular teenager would have to know about a vast array of topics , ranging from Boy George to The Cure , not leaving aside Shakespeare .
Of course , these are not exactly academic subjects , so an academic knowledge of Boy George would not be necessary , but we would have to at least have heard of him .
Shakespeare , however , is not only part of the academy , but also of a canon .
Would it be better , then , to know everything about the Bard and all of his forty plays , or to know a few vital facts about him and still have time to study Orwell , Huxley , Nabokov , Salinger , Woolf , Twain and Steinbeck , not to mention less canonical authors ?

It 's hard to say , since there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach .
One obvious con to having a broad knowledge of several subjects is that this knowlegde will eventually become superficial .
Lack of time will make it impossible to dedicate too much attention to one subject , and its treatment might be shallow and futile .
On the other hand , knowing many subjects will surely enhance our conversational skills in social gatherings .
Let 's just say that knowing Macbeth superficially wo n't be enough to write a thesis on the play , but it might impress some friends at a party .
It depends on the situation .

Although I do n't have a fixed opinion on this subject , I 'm more inclined to having broad knowledge about many topics than merely knowing one topic exhaustively .
In school at least , we have to be introduced to many academic subjects , for how will we know where to choose from and what interests to pursue if we only , say , know Algebra ?
As we go deeper and deeper into our studies , however , we will inevitably have to narrow down our interests , and dedicate more time to fewer subjects , even running the `` risk '' of becoming specialists .

"I agree with the statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
.

First , a broader knowledge of many academic subjects enables an individual to be diverse : being involved in different projects , conversations , and work groups .
By concentrating on one single subject specifically , a person might always be involved with the same people , performing the same tasks , and thinking in a similar way .
By having knowledge , as broad as it might be , of different subjects , an individual is rescued from monotony and involved in interesting and dynamic conversations and group work .

Let us say that a student is specializing in biology .
If he only works on this specific academic subject he might grow tired of having the same conversations and working on the same types of projects .
If , on the other hand , he included some subjects on engineering and arts , for example , he would get involved in different conversations , making his life more interesting and helping him grow , maybe even in the area of his preference , biology .

Second , knowledge of many different subjects enables one to know , identify , and appreciate the connection and relationship between different subjects .
This is especially important in problem solving .
For example , a specialist in manufacturing processes might normally deal with problems related to equipment , tolerances , and procedures .
Faced with a problem not related to what he would normally deal with , this person might feel overwhelmed and not know how to deal with the problem .
However , if this individual decided to acquire a general knowledge about logistics , administration , and human resources he might know , at least , what direction to take in order to solve the problem .

Knowing an array of different academic subjects in a broad level compared to specializing on a specific subject , ensures diversity , scope expansion and more developed problem solving skills .

"Nowadays exist a lot of people that study an specific profession , and when they finished it they realized they they do n't really like it , so they work in an area that they do n't enjoy .
What is worst people study a profession and after a year or two years they change to other profession , and they can do this many times , so they waist their time trying to find something that they really like and they enjoy .
So I agree with the statement that says that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

If you spend time studing differents subjects , and expanding your knowledge , later you will have more options to decide what you really want to study .
Because you will have study different types of subjects , and you will have more options at the time you choose a profession .
And the college you aply will see that you have studied subjects related to the profession you aplied to .

Another advantage of studing many academic subjects , is that you will have spend time in many different types of subjects , so at the end you will know in what subjects you are really good at .
That way you wo n't enter to a college to study a profession that later you realize that you are not good at , and because of that you will have to change your profession and you will waist your time .

Finally we can say that studing different academic subjects , you will expand your knowledge , you will see some of every subject , you will learn different kind of things , and your knowledge will grow .
So in the future , maybe when you have children , you can teach them what you have learned , eventhough it does n't refer to the profession you studied .
You will always have that knowledge with you .

As a conclusion I can state that I agree with the option that says that is better to have a broad knowledge of different academic subjects .
It will help you in many things in the future .
You will be a mor versatile person .

"The statement agreeing with having a broad knowledge and not a subject-specified knowledge is to one extent wrong .
Having a broad knowledge on many academic subjects might be a positive thing but in the end there is the need of some kind of specialization in order to achieve and get some results .

During the years of formation ( middle and high school ) a range of subjects is needed in order to give the student a chance to get a better idea on where they want to specify later on in their lives .
But once school is over some kind of specialization needs to be required .
Children and teenagers are required to learn no many subjects not because it is better to have a broader knowledge but because they are not old enough to choose which specialized subject they want to pursue .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is the same as having shallow knowledge on something .
With this shallow knowledge no results can be achieved and the result , in the end , is someone that knows a little about everything and nothing about something specific .

Engineers , doctors , lawyers are all specialized in their on subject .
This professions that are the most respected ones are based on specific knowledge and not on broad knowledge .
There is no time or real need for a doctor to know about law and how the judicial system works as long as he knows about his own profession and how to apply medicine .

There is something called General Culture that everyone should learn and use in every day basis but it should not be the only knowledge a person has .
The general culture should be accompanied by some kind of specified knowledge on something that would lead to something .
People that only have general culture do not have enough knowledge to pursue a carreer that would lead somewhere in the future .

The Nobel prizes , for example , are subject-specified and there is no General Culture Nobel Prize .
The physicist that earns the Physics Nobel Prize has specified knowledge that accompanied with research and work in this subject led him to a discovery .

In the end , what is needed in the world of today is a general sense of what is going in the world ( i.e. General Culture ) with some specified knowledge in a subject that might lead to an achievement that would help the world in general .
Having only specified knowledge is also a negative thing because there is a dettachment of the real world that could harm a person and disconect him from the world .

"In our actual society , which is currently developing faster and faster everyday , it is necessary to be posted on many new findings in diverse fields of science .
Since every field is getting broader as it goes , one may have to choose between having a general knowledge on several fields , or specializing on a certain matter .
I choose the second option .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be a good thing , if you can handle it .
In order for that to happen , one would have to study different areas , which would leave less time to know deeply each and everyone of them This would mean that , although having knowledge on many subjects , they would be somewhat shallow .
In contrast , it would give you a large list of subjects to talk about with friends and family .

On the other hand , specializing in one specific subject would lead a person to have a profound understanding of the matter .
It is what everyone expects from proffesionals in many fields .
For instance , no one would like to have a surgery if he knows that the surgeon who is going to procede does not know much about the matter .
You might as well get killed with a gun if that is the case .
This example is suitable for any other field , such as economics , or even music .
In proffesional matters , a person who knows more on a single matter is more apreciatted than one who know too many little things .

To conclude , I would say that both kinds of knowledge are important , but having to choose , I would go for specializing in one subject over having broad knowledge of many subjects , because it is more important when it comes to being a good proffesional , whatever career you choose .

"In the world we live in today , education is one of the most valuable assets a person can have .
If we where to be living in the 19th century , it would be better to have borad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific thing .
During those ages , specialization was not very important .
It was more important if one had a broad knowledge of many subjects .
One can see that for example , Taylorism , which was basically a new form of working in plants ( it was based in speciallization of workers and a good management so that workers would n't loose time ) , was only taken into account during the first part of the twentieth century with the arrival of the production line invented by Henry Ford .
Before that , people did n't take into account specialization , because there was no need to .
There were no procesess involving specific actions or functions .

Nevertheless , we are not living in the 19th centruy .
We are already in the twenty first , where a carrer is very important .
The more one studies , the more probable is that one will do well in their future .

The world is becoming every day more and more competitive .
Every year , there are millions of people who go into the labour market , and compete between themselves for a better job .
The only way to differentiate a potential good job applicant form a bad , one is the studies they have .
If one applicant has studied a lot , and the other has not , it is more probable that the one who has better studies will get the gob .

Besides that , there is the subject of specialization in specific areas .
Nowadays , firms are demanding very specific kinds of workers .
Workers who have specialized in very specific areas , in which other worker would not be able to perform the task .

This type of demand for specific workers is becoming greater and greater every day .
This is why one would think that , living in the competitive world that we live today , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

"I think is good if you can have knowledge of many subjects , but today , if you want to be effective and competitive , you should specialize in one specific subject .
The problem is the following : nowaday the knowledge has been increased a lot and this proccess go on .
In example , the natural science is increasing the knowledge day to day and there are a lot of information about complicated proccess as DNA replication that years ago did not seem possible to discover easily .
On the other hand , the specific knowledge has a great problem .
When a person is more especific can lose capacity to analize minor problems .
It is probably that the people with specific knoledge would try explain all the problem under their vision .
In example , a doctor who work with pshycology , probably he would try to explain a lot of cases trougth the pshycology .

Therefore , I think that the best position is support the two types of knowledge .
The government should care that people in their countries have the opportunity to choose both things and the governments could manage how many people take place in one or another possibility trougth policies and fellowships for students .
The final objective is that the country will have proffessional people in both areas and each area will have their function .
In that case , the specific area provide knowledge to general areas when this need it .
In example , a group of researchs discover a new medicine and they should give the medicine to doctors who works with the patients .

In conclusion , both types of knowledge ( general and specific ) are neccessaries to support the science advance ( the increase of the knowledge ) and the normal life ( the solution to the common problems ) .

"Knowledge is a very powerful tool .
The more you know about something , the better informed and prepared you are on the subject .
If having knowledge in one area is good , it 's even better to know about many subjects .
Having an integral education provides you with the base to be able to speak , even if at short length , about many topics .
You are able to move throughout a wider social spectrum because you can relate to a larger group of people .

That being said I think it 's important to specialize in one specific subject .
Experts have a very important place in our society .
They are recognized by governments , academia and many other places .
Their specialized information is valued because other people do n't know it .
Specializing in one specific subject leads you down a path of expertise .
Even better is when you can specialize in more than one subject .
This way , you can combine different fields and create new paths of knowledge .

Specializing in a subject ( whether it be one or more ) also opens a space to community .
Although a specific subject might not have a large range of people attached to it compared to people who have a broad knowledge , it is a more close and tightly knit group .
There 's a development of traditions , rules and language that pertain to that specific group .
Take into consideration medical and legal jargon , which might sound like a foreign language to people who do n't have knowledge in that specific field .
It is a way to communicate with people from the same `` tribe '' .
People from similar fields also are able to develop very strong relationships because they can understand the complexities of a particular subject .

We cannot overlook the importance of having an education that comprises of a wide variety of subjects .
This training enables you to be a constructive part of society .
But since everyone ca n't be laying down blocks ( there 's also need of solders , sculptors , painters , etc. ) , there is also a need to specialize in a particular field so you can offer society the best part of yourself : your knowledge .

"Undoubtedly , this is one of the most trite debates that have taken part in the last decades .
After dedicating a big part of my energies to dealing with this so intricate topic , I reached the conclusion that the election between specializing or multiplying knowledge depends on a more deep debate , which is choosing between good education ( and here I refer to Good with capital letters ) and economic success .

Postmodern era has brought with it the problem of defying traditional views not only about the organization of the world but mainly about the virtues of certain kind of knowledges .
While in the ancient eras it was easy to grasp different disciplines , the huge increase in the mass of science production that took place during the XIX and XX th. centuries really difficulted the possibility of dealing with different types of knowledges .

Today , it seems to be that certain disciplines are clearly priviledged in the market .
Specialization is not only very valued in companies ( that may need engineers or marketing professionals ) , but in the academic world .
Although it seems to be reasonable in terms of efficiency ( the more you mechanically know anything about something , the faster you find a solution or give a response to a certain problem ) , it does not appear to be the same when facing unconventional or even life challenges .

In this last sense , I think that multidisciplinary knowledge can add value to one 's education .
Holistic visions of situations may help to deal with more complex problems and may provide people with mental frameworks for acting in different scenarios and in front of different kinds of people .
My experience has shown me that the more specialized you are , the more difficulty you find to understand problems that may go a bit beyond your perspective .
Moreover , you tend to see life through the lens provided by the discipline you are expert in .
This was very frequent for me at university , where I used to talk to professors that tended to refuse or discard theories that took ideas from other areas of knowledge .
Typically , for Political Scientists all problems arise from politics , and from Economists everything has to do with economics .
It appears to be very simplistic my statement , but I really had to pass over those situations when pursuing a multidisciplionary degree ( International Affairs ) and dealing with PhD professors from very different areas .

Unfortunately , this surplus I perceive in broad knowledge is not valued by market and , as I said before , it may be almost legitime in terms of rapid efectiveness .
However , I do not think the debate is over .
On the contrary , I think it will evolve in tandem with the evolution or cycles of human advances .
In the while , my curiosity and eagerness for really understanding all this lead me to buy books on Astronomy , zapping between National Geographic and History Channel , or listening to Religion lectures .
So far , it has been very fruitful for my life .

"The question of whether it is better to have little knowledge in lots of subjects , or to have lots of knowledge in a specific subject , has been a theme of discussions for many years , specially for students .
I personally agree with the statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' , but only up to a certain point .

If a person has broad knowledge of many subjects , he will be able to talk to other people about this subjects and develope a conversation about the topic .
If the person has knowledge in only one subject , he will only be able to develop conversations about that specific subject , therefore there will be less people he will be able to talk to .
Also , a person with a broad knowledge in many subject can be seen as a better overall prepared and informed person .
He could be able to understand news , for instance , better than a person who does n't know what 's being talked about because it 's not his subject .

On the other hand , specialized knowledge has its advantages .
In a job interview for a specific carreer , for example , the person with more knowledge in the area will definetely be chosen over the person with less knowledge in the area and more overall knowledge .
Thus the specialized knowledge guy can make a better living .
Also with more knowlegde on a specific subject you can discuss the subject with another person in , just about , all possible details .

As we can see , both statements have their pros and contras .
My personal opinion and recomendation to anyone is to have both : a broad knowledge in many subjects and lots of knowledge in a specific one .
If so , you can defend yourself in any subject and be the best you can be in a particular one .
That 's also why I agree with the school systems that teach broad knowledge in many subjects up to a certain point of maturity , or level reached , and then let one decide in what subject one wants to specialize .
I think it is the best way to prepare people to live in such a complex society , like the one we live in today .

"To answer if I agree or disagree with this statement , I have to make some distinctions .
There are some profession that need a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and some that do not .

Professions like scientists in specific regions , lets say microbiologists , need a specialization .
That means that they will start to study general biology and later specialize for microbiology .
They might need general knowledge about statictis , mathematics and maybe some terms in the latin lannguage , but they do not need to study economy or philosophy .

On the other hand there are some professions where a broad knowledge is needed .
A director of a movie will need complex understanding of many different subjects .
He will have to deal with actors , so he will need probably some knowledge about psychology .
He will need to understand the finances of this project , have knowleadge about technical issues to communicate with the camera , light and editing team .
Further he will need to outweight the importance of every upcoming problem , where he will need managing skills like timemanagement .

On the other hand , if you have enough time to study what you like and what you are passionate for , it will always be of help .
Nowadays we live in a fast changing world with upcoming challenges .
No jobs will replace ohters and to have diffrent knowledges and skills will always help to increase the amount of possibilites where to work .
I think that one has to see the opportunity costs and listen to one 's heart what is really important for

"Broad knowledge is more effective because it enhances diversity .
As for today 's world , development and technology requires human beings to have extensive knowledge and display multifacetic characteristics .
We do not live anymore in a world where we were forced to specialize in one thing to survive .
Today , it works differently .
People are now exposed to more information and learning , thus stretching there overall knowledge .
The vast range of information , together with people 's desire to succeed , make them better prepared for the unknown future .

The 21st century brought with it the availability of information , thus promoting faster learing .
With this phenomenon , people are exposed to vast amounts of information that allow them to develop and grow .
For example , some who is more aware of world events is more praised than someone who only knows about the war going on in Iraq .
By having the mechanisms to obtain information , people want more and more , thus creating competition .
If you are competing for a job place as an accountant suppose , and your rival knowns computer managing in addition to accounting , while you just know accounting , your rival results more efficient for the company .

The disire to succeed in this world creates a lot of competition amongst the people .
With the wide range of information and technologies , the world expects people for more , thus we are forced to learn more things .
Diversity then comes in play in this situation .
Today , success is about being efficient and useful .
Hence , people who know how to do more things and better understand more things , is rather wanted .

In conclusion , in relation to the present world , knowledge in better appriciated for its quantity rather than quality .
Obviously , everything has its limits , for some has to understand at least the basics of many things .

"I do agree with the statement .
It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

Having broad knowledge of many academical subjects offers the student to conceptualize a wider range of subjects and information from the world that surrounds them ; students that get broad knowledge , knows where to get whatever information they need under a given situation that might raise in their professional life .

Students gets during their academic studies , information about bibliography reference , knowing where to look for a broader set of issues than whose specialized for just one thing .

The brain can hold a limited quantity of information .
From every day 's life , we aquire huge quantities of it .
When specializing in one specifical subject , if we dont usually practice it in a daily basis , we might tend to forget about important things related to that specifical subject we 've been prepared for .
Although with broad education , students would tend to forget even more than with specialized education about all the different subjects , they get to conceptualize the most important basics of each .

Even if specializing into specifical subjects can maximize how a person will solve a problem , and give an indepth analisys in his own area , if his professional area becomes obsolete by any reason , ( technological means , substitute activities ) they then become obsolete for working in different areas .

We can also add another reason that is ; what if the professional becomes tired of working in the field he academically specialized ? ...
Would have to get academical studies again in a different professional area !

In example of this , if someone whose grade has been into the telecommunications field , and there one day gets tired of working in telecommunications , routers , switchs , commands ! , he or her becomes practically doomed to keep working in that they specialized for , for the rest of his or her days .

Instead , if the student chooses Computer Science , there is a much wider range of possibilities .
He 's able to develop systems in whatever area he wants to work for , including telecommunications !

From a social point of view , specializing into one specific subject might lead to isolation .
This can happen in ways that the person gets so specialized into something , that knows nothing about the rest of humanity ; gets not much to talk about , or even understand basic fundamentals of different areas .

"I think it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

In my own experience , I have seen this all along my life and work .
If you specialize in only one specific subject , you will always be limited to a very small field of action and will not be able to work or give opinions in other areas that could be related to yours if that were the case .

This tendency sytarted with Ford company in the assembly lines in the beginning of the century when Henry Ford launched his first mass produced car .
every person in the assembly line had a specific task to carry out and that was all they did .
Well , at the very beginning , this might have been good but after a while I do not think that those people like their jobs very much .
It is boring and routinary and of course production levels decrease .
And this does not only happen in an assembly line , it can be applied to every field of action .

During the eighties this specialization had a terrible drawback General Motors Corporation fired a lot of workers and obviously these people were not prepared to find and do another job but what they had been doing for a long time .
Those workers had to even go back to school in oreder to learn something else to do in todays world .

This fact and other make me agree with the statement .
When you know different subjects and have knowledge of them you are more prepared to survive in this everyday changing society , you can adapt more to those changes if you are used to manage something from different areas of knowledge .

I am a teacher of English in my country but first of all I am a teacher who teaches values , habits , culture , etc. and then I teach English .
In this country , the United States , I try to do the same .
That is I am applying my experiences and adapting them to a totally new atmosphere were my culture and habits could be old fashioned or not accepted .
Even , I have had to learn from other cultures in order to deliver my information better and more accurately .

As an another example , I like to answer those questions about culture and all types of knowledge of the television contests , and of course I like it when my answer is the correct one .

Sometimes specialization is good but we never have to be so specialized on something we need to know about everything that is around us and that affect the way we live .
I can not only drive my car not knowing that I am also depleting the ozone layer when I do it .
We have to be more concious and in order to do so we need the most important thing these days KNOWLEDGE .

"Having a lot of knowledges could lead one to not know a lot about anything .
If this is true , many would not be able to specialize on anything due to the fact they do not know enough about a subject , to have a job or specialize in it .
Thus in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject , in order to suceed in and perfect the subject which one is studying .

A doctor , needs to focus on the medical aspect of its career in other to excel on it .
If a doctor were to study many subjects at the same time , he or she would get distracted from its main specialization which is saving lives or working in a hospital .
Ofcourse , the doctor should know a bit about english , grammar , and other subjects esential to live , but the doctor should not focus entirely on those subjects , because they are not as important as a biology class can be .

If someone specializes in one specific subject and gives all its attention to it , one will have greater possibilites of excelling and learning about the subject .
For example , in my school we use to have 13 courses per semester , and people did not have time to focus on any single subject as instensively as they should or wanted to , because it was too muh work .
After a while , the school changed its policy and decieded to cut down the courses to 5 , in which people could take math , science and spanish and other two courses of their choice .
Students started to pull up their grades because it was easier to focus on the subject one liked and specialize on the subject that was related to the career one wanted to pursue later on in life , for example people would take 2 classes of math , and were able to focus and specialize in math for the future of their bussiness career .

Although it is good to know about many subjects , in my opinion it is imposible to learn and really excell on them while one is studying many different subjects .
In that case students are learning the esential things about the subjects , but are not taking the time in any of them to specialize and pronfundize their knowledge in a certain subject .
If a doctor would broaden his or her knowledge , he or she would probably never look deep into medicine subjects , and would just have the broad or overview of it .
Making this a disadvantage for them and us patients .
Also if my school would not have lowered the number of courses , students would have never been able to really specialize in a subject , but would have simply seen the overview of it , never fully understanding each and every one of those subjects .
Therefore in my opinion it is better to know a lot about something , than to know a little about everything .

"It is important to have a good background and have a broad knowledge but there is a point when specializing in one specific subject is needed .

There is no doubt that a proffessional needs a broad knowldege of many diffferents subjects to build a strong background .
For example a petroleum engineer , like me , must take a lot of subjects which could appearently not be related to what a petroleum engineer needs to learn in order explore , exploit or process oil .
Such is the case of subjects like learning techniques , computer programming or environmental education but those subjects definetely help on the way you learn the specialized subjects as in learning techniques , or how a program can be used to solve a problem on computer programing or even how to prevent an environmental impact during any stage of oil process .

Although all those subjects mentioned before and others , can give an engineer a good background , after that point an engineer must specialized to focus the atention on a major in wich , as I can see , the more work an attention you pay on the more you will be able to succed on .
Continuing with the example , on petroleum engineering , there are three major specifique branches : reservoir , drilling and production , acording to wich the attention will be focussed on find and characterize the location of the place where the hydrocarbon is , to create the conditions to bring the oil to the surface or to handle it when it has reached the surface respectively .
In order to specialize on one of those field or branches , specific subjects must be taken .

According to what I 've previously pointed , I think that is important to specialize , as in the example mentioned above , in one mayor field wich can lead to an focused attention environment in a major that would be studied and researched resulting on an improved and focused knowledge .

"Historically , to have a broad knowledge of subjects was perceived as part of a culturally enriched society .
If we take a peek at the ancient greeks we see that all their main philosophers ( Platon , Aristoteles or Socrates ) were considered to be experts in many fields .
But time has changed and nowadays specialization has become more and more important .

Having said this , I ca n't totally disagree with this tendency .
I believe that in our modern society , if you want to stand out from the rest you need to specialize and become an expert on your area or field .
A good example of this is what the labour market is currently demanding .
If you do n't have a job because you are not specialized or expert enough , how can you wish to have a broader knowledge ?

Different is if , in your spare time , you devote it to persue other academic knowledge , that 's fine .
But I believe that the real reason why many people choose to a very specific academic knowledge and a certain career path is because this will assure them the suficient ` know how ' they will need in th future tu secure a job position .

Educational authorities and responsibles should have a say in all this .
From my perspective the educational laws should provide the opportunity to the students to choose a wider spectrum of subjects as longer as possible .
To be honest , this will not be possible always , there will a time that the student will have to focus in which path he or she will like to continue in .
But the later we prolongue this decision , the better .

To summarize , if we lived in an ideal world we could all know about a lot of subjects but this is n't like this .
The reality is avery different one and we have to apply to it .
The society wants ` experts ' and we know it , so we play by the book .

"With a broad knowledge you can understand the world and with a specialization in a subject you may be the most recurred person in the whole world .
Which path should one take ?
That 's a topic that many young people deal with .
Let 's discuss some relevant points .

Having a broad knowledge of many essential subjects , such as history , mathematics , biology and language is not only important in order to climb the latter of education but also for the development of one 's ideas , personality and tolerance towards others .
You can be able to understand the world , draw conclusions and interrelate the different subjects , and therefore have a deeper and more coherent view of things .
For example , if you have learnd about Darwin and his theory about the `` survival oh the fittest '' and have a knowledge in history you would know how this biological theory applies in society , in which powerful and wealthy people rule most of the time .

On the other hand , being specialized in one specific subject could mean being the most known person in that area and people will recurr to you more than to anyone else who does not have the knowledge you have on a specific matter .
You may not understand the whole world , but have answers to questions and are able to analyse things that no one else could .
For example , if you have a unique disease , a bacterial infection , you would recurr to a specialist in that area and not tho your grandfather that has a very broad cultural knowledge .

In my opinion you should n't choose one path but both .
Throughout your whole life you should be interested to expand your broad knowledge , let it be by studying or travelling .
It is indispensable to know about many subjects in order to understand each of one , since everything interrelates in one world .
Broad knowledge is the basis of your futher area of study that you may want to pursue if you are interest in a specific matter .

"I disagree with the prior statement for several reasons .
When we say that is is better to do this or that , we should ask ourselves : better for whom ?
Is it better for me , for the others , for society as a whole ?
I think that altough a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be fruitful for individuals , societies rely more and more on specialized knowledge .
And this is why i disagree with the statement .

The first argument is that if a society values knowledge , and ours does , then it should realize that the pursuit of knowledge is fostered by intense research in areas that become by necessity the object of further and further specialization .
To increase our knowledge about things , be it nature , or the social realm , or just abstract math , we need researchers to constantly go beyond what they already know .
It is only by being at the forefront of a given discipline that we can gain more knowledge about it .

The second argument in support of specialized knowledge is that we , as a society - even though there are relevant exceptions - , do not pursue knowledge only for knowledge 's sake .
We use knowledge in order to satisfy an objective , be it the improvement of our societies , or of our health , or whatever it is we want to improve .
Doctors want to heal people , engineers want to build bridges .
Most of our society 's needs depend on specialized knowledge .
Broad knowledge of many subjects can serve the spirit , but the well-being of modern societies requires more than well-educated , well-rounded citizens .

Last but not least , our societies , which we value , as we have already said , need to be sustainable in the long term .
Sustainability - economic , social , ecological - is a complex issue and we as a society need to educate people that should be able to treat this complex phenomena .

These are some of the reasons why we can say that specialized knowledge is better for our societies and therefore that is is better to have this kind of knowledge than having broad knowledge of many subjects .
That said , individuals should be interested in areas in which they are not specialized , because thirst of knowledge is part of being human and it makes our societies richer in variety and more interesting .

"Regarding the question of agreeing or disagreeing with the statement that indicates that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' , I would have to disagree .
The main reason : why pick one side of the balance , when - at least in this case - you can choose both ?

I think that the specific knowledge of a subject does not excuse a person of knowing other subjects , even if it is at a small level .
Knowledge always complements our activities and , most importantly , it complements ourselves .
Knowledge makes us more complete individuals and better professionals , no matter what activity , profession or craft we practice .

Imagine if the statement was true ...
If we could only pick one side of the balance it could be inferrered that an Aeronautical Engineer would not be able to sustain a conversation with the Louvre Museum curator , for example .
Do you imagine what they both would be missing ?

Regarding the second part of the statement reffering to `` broad knowledge of many academic subjects '' I disagree based on personal experience .
I 'm a journalist , and in my country there 's a saying that states that journalists have `` an ocean of knowledge ...
only one inch deep '' .
This highly offends me , because it generalizes the idea that a journalist is not able to conduct and actual investigation on a subject ( because of his lack of knowledge depth ) .
On the other hand , I 've seen journalists use this `` statement '' as an excuse for their lack of knowledge and investigative capacities , which offends me even more !

Why not have specific subject knowledge combined with broad knowledge of other subjects ?
For me , this is the perfect choice : It allows me to become a more complete professional and person , and to talk and exchange ideas with a variety of people and professionals , which derives into constant learning of new things .

This would also make the world a much `` social '' place : everybody could satisfactory discuss topics and exchange ideas with lots of different people .
The world would n't be made of `` knowledge ghettos '' ( Engineers Vs .
Artists , Musicians Vs .
Chemists ) .

"A very common question posed by students revolves around what it is better , either having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject ?
Grounds can be held to support any of the two possible answers .
In fact , both have advantages and disadvantages , but as far as I am concerned , to specialize in a single field seems to be the right answer .
I will give three reasons to back up my choice .

First af all , it seems undeniable that nowadays the labor market is demanding for very young and capable employees , usually already holding a Master 's degree .
Neither this young people nor the educational system can disregard this fact , and the Universities must encourage their students to specialize and focus specifically on certain and well-defined subjects .

Moreover , we have to put special emphasis in the fact that recent psychological researches are showing that acquiring expertise on a specific field of knowledge , is a way for people to feel fully happy with themselves .

A third point refers to the fact that studying a subject seriously and at great length takes a great deal of time , and makes it very difficult to deep in any other subjects .
We do not want our students to become second-rate proffessionals in their careers .

To sum up , given the current expectations on the entrepreneurs ' part and thus , in the labor market , it is important for society in general and for academia in particular facing up to reality and encourage the students to follow the right direction : specialization .

Nevertheless , arguments holding the other way round , that is , the importance of acquire a broad knowledge of many academic subjects cannot be completely swept aside either .
In my book , well-educated people need to have a very high level of acquaintance of a certain field ( law , science , literature , etc. ) , but at the same time , it is very satisfactory to devote some time to different activities ( cultural activities , sports , and so forth and so on ) .

"I disagree with the statement that considers it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject .
In the following paragraphs , I will attempt to explain my position from different perspectives .

In my opinion , someone who knows `` little about a lot '' , will probably be unfamiliar with the specifics in each of the areas he or she knows `` a little '' about .
The probable outcome is that this person wo n't be able to do anything his own and will need specialists in each area to help him or her .

Instead , if that person were to specialize in at least one area , then people can go to the person for help on a specific matter .
The person can , in turn , ask for help or advice in areas beyond his or her expertise .
From an economic perspective , I think that this optimizes resources .
From a social perspective , I think that this creates social interaction , since people will continue to need from each other .
It also prevents mistakes .
Why ?
Because many mistakes are made by those who think they know .

Finally , I think that the future is tending to a world of more specialists .
In day to day life , we see that universities offer very specific courses .
On the other hand , we see that companies are demanding precisely that .
It is no longer sufficient to be a lawyer , or a tax lawyer - for example - since some companies are looking for a specialist in transfer pricing , which is a very specific part of tax law .

Many centuries ago , the total amount of scientific knowledge was not very big .
One usually think of a man of the 16 century , say Galileo , as a complete man only if he or she master all the aspect of science .
Nowadays , every specific discipline has grown to an extend that it is impossible to master it all .
For example , lets concentrate on Physics .
There are lots of very specific sub-fields , like Barion Particle Physics or Maser Optics .
It is impossible to know everything about all the specific sub-fields , even if we concentrate only in Physics .
Since it is not possible to master an entire discipline like Physics , I think the best option is to try to know a little bit about everything .

Second , people specialized in a specific subject can find very hard to interact with other scientists .
Every discipline has its own mathematical tools , its own vocabulary and its own way of thinking .
Therefore it is really difficult to get a good interaction between a Biologist and a Geologist .
A person who can handle many academic subjects can interact with a lot of people .

Third , a scientist who has a broad knowledge can always get advise from a expert in a specific field when needed .
It will be much harder for an expert to get an aplication of his knowledge in other fields because of the lack of knowledge of the potential applications .
For example , it could be really hard for a Matematiscian to get an application of some probability theory to sociology .
On the other hand , a sociologist that knows a little of mathematics , could ask an expert all the questions he or she has .

In conclusion , I think it is a better strategy to try to manage several disciplines .
One can always get advise from an expert if needed .
Also it will be easier to interact for a person who knows about several academic subjects .

"I respectfully disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. While it is true that youth is often associated with vitality, energy, and a sense of freedom, enjoyment of life is subjective and can vary greatly from individual to individual regardless of age.

Older people have the advantage of life experience, which can lead to a deeper appreciation of the small moments and a greater sense of contentment. They have likely overcome challenges, gained wisdom, and developed a stronger sense of self-awareness. This can contribute to a more profound enjoyment of life's nuances and complexities.

Moreover, older individuals often have a stronger sense of gratitude for the things they have achieved and the relationships they have nurtured over the years. This gratitude can lead to a more profound sense of fulfillment and satisfaction in life.

While young people may have more physical energy and fewer responsibilities, they may also face uncertainties about the future, societal pressures, and the challenges of self-discovery. These factors can impact their ability to fully enjoy the present moment.

On the other hand, older individuals may derive enjoyment from different sources, such as deeper connections with loved ones, a sense of accomplishment from their life's work, or the wisdom gained through years of experience.

"Introduction

The perception that young people enjoy life more than older individuals is a topic of debate. While some argue that youth brings a sense of freedom and vitality that enhances enjoyment, others believe that older individuals have a deeper appreciation for life's nuances. In my opinion, both age groups have unique perspectives on life that contribute to their enjoyment in different ways.

Body

Young people often have a carefree attitude towards life, unencumbered by responsibilities and obligations that come with age. They have a sense of adventure and a willingness to explore new experiences, which can lead to a greater enjoyment of life. Additionally, young individuals tend to have more energy and enthusiasm, allowing them to fully immerse themselves in activities and pursuits that bring them joy.

On the other hand, older individuals have the advantage of wisdom and experience, which can lead to a more profound sense of fulfillment and contentment. They have likely overcome challenges and setbacks, gaining a deeper understanding of what truly matters in life. Older people may find joy in simple moments and meaningful relationships, appreciating the beauty in everyday experiences.

Conclusion

In conclusion, both young and older individuals have the capacity to enjoy life in their unique ways. While youth may bring a sense of vitality and excitement, age brings wisdom and a deeper appreciation for life's complexities. Ultimately, enjoyment of life is subjective and can be experienced at any age, depending on one's perspective and attitude towards life's experiences.",P2,SPA,high,1
"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Age does not determine one's capacity for enjoyment or happiness. In fact, older individuals often have a deeper appreciation for life due to their wealth of experiences and wisdom.

Firstly, older people have had the opportunity to learn from their past experiences and mistakes, which allows them to make more informed decisions and savor the present moment. Their perspective on life is often more nuanced and they are able to find joy in the simple things that younger individuals may overlook.

Secondly, older people have usually established strong relationships with family and friends over the years, providing them with a strong support system and source of happiness. These connections contribute significantly to their overall enjoyment of life.

Moreover, older individuals often have more free time to pursue their passions and interests, as they may be retired or have fewer responsibilities compared to younger people who are still building their careers or raising families.

In conclusion, age should not be equated with enjoyment of life. Older individuals have a wealth of experiences, deeper relationships, and more time to pursue their interests, all of which contribute to their ability to find happiness and fulfillment.

"I strongly agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young individuals often possess a sense of excitement, curiosity, and a willingness to explore new experiences that can enhance their overall enjoyment of life.

Firstly, young people typically have fewer responsibilities compared to older individuals. They have more freedom to pursue their passions, travel, try new things, and take risks without as many consequences. This sense of freedom and lack of constraints can lead to a higher level of enjoyment and fulfillment in their daily lives.

Furthermore, young people are more likely to be in the peak of their physical health and energy levels. This allows them to engage in various activities, such as sports, adventures, and socializing, which can bring joy and excitement to their lives. As people age, they may face health issues or physical limitations that can hinder their ability to fully enjoy and participate in such activities.

Lastly, young people often have a more optimistic outlook on life. They are more open to change, growth, and new possibilities, which can contribute to a more positive and enjoyable mindset. Older individuals may be more set in their ways, resistant to change, and burdened by past experiences, which can impact their ability to fully appreciate and enjoy life.

Older people have accumulated wisdom and life experience that allows them to appreciate the simple pleasures and moments of happiness more deeply.

The statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do is subjective and can vary depending on individual experiences and perspectives. While it may be commonly believed that young people have more opportunities for excitement and exploration, it is important to consider that older individuals also derive enjoyment from life in different ways.

Older individuals have had the opportunity to learn from their mistakes, develop meaningful relationships, and appreciate the simple pleasures in life.

Moreover, older people may find fulfillment in different aspects such as spending quality time with family, pursuing hobbies they are passionate about, or simply enjoying a quiet moment of reflection. Their ability to savor the present moment and find contentment in small gestures can lead to a more profound sense of joy compared to the fleeting excitement that young people often seek.

In conclusion, while young people may appear to enjoy life more on the surface, the depth and richness of experience that come with age can bring a different, perhaps more profound, kind of joy. Both young and older individuals have their unique strengths and perspectives that contribute to their enjoyment of life.",P2,SPA,high,1
"I firmly disagree with the notion that young people enjoy life more than older people do. While it may seem that young people have more energy and enthusiasm for new experiences, older individuals often derive a deeper sense of fulfillment and contentment from life. 

Firstly, older people have the advantage of life experience, which allows them to appreciate the small joys and moments of happiness that young people may overlook. They have developed a greater understanding of what truly matters in life and have cultivated meaningful relationships that bring them joy and satisfaction.

Additionally, older individuals have often achieved a level of financial stability and career success that can enhance their enjoyment of life. With fewer worries about the future and a greater sense of security, they are able to savor the present moment and engage in activities that bring them happiness.

Moreover, older people may have more time to pursue their passions and hobbies, as they have likely retired from their careers and have more freedom to do what they love. This can lead to a deeper sense of fulfillment and enjoyment in life.

In conclusion, while young people may have a zest for life and a sense of adventure, older individuals often possess a more profound appreciation for the beauty and richness of life. Their life experiences, wisdom, and sense of contentment enable them to enjoy life in a way that young people may not yet understand.",P2,SPA,high,1
"I strongly agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. One of the main reasons for this is the sense of freedom and endless possibilities that come with youth. Young people typically have fewer responsibilities, greater physical vitality, and a more optimistic outlook on life.

Young people often have the luxury of exploring different paths, trying new experiences, and taking risks without as much fear of consequences. This sense of freedom allows them to fully immerse themselves in the present moment and make the most of their lives. For example, a young person might decide to travel the world, start a new career, or pursue a passion without being weighed down by the same level of commitments that older individuals often face.

Additionally, young people tend to have higher energy levels and a more adventurous spirit, which enables them to engage in a wide range of activities and experiences. Whether it's trying extreme sports, going to music festivals, or simply staying out late with friends, young people have the stamina and enthusiasm to fully embrace life's adventures.

In contrast, older individuals often have more responsibilities such as careers, families, and financial obligations, which can limit their ability to fully enjoy life in the same carefree way that young people can. Moreover, as people age, they may face health issues or physical limitations that can impact their enjoyment of life.

These experiences can bring a sense of fulfillment that transcends the fleeting excitement often associated with youth.

Moreover, older individuals tend to have a more stable sense of self-awareness and acceptance, which can lead to a greater overall sense of happiness. With age comes wisdom and a better understanding of what truly matters in life, allowing older individuals to prioritize their well-being and focus on meaningful relationships and experiences.

While young people may have a sense of novelty and energy that comes with youth, it does not necessarily equate to a deeper or more fulfilling enjoyment of life.

"Title: The Joy of Youth vs. the Wisdom of Age: Exploring Perspectives on Enjoying Life

The debate over whether young people enjoy life more than older individuals has sparked varied opinions. While it can be argued that young people have the advantage of boundless energy and a sense of invincibility, I believe that older individuals also derive immense joy from life, albeit in different ways. 

Young people often experience life with a sense of wonder and excitement. Their enthusiasm for new experiences and adventures knows no bounds. But does this exuberance necessarily equate to a deeper enjoyment of life? On the other hand, older individuals may savor life's simple pleasures with a sense of gratitude and contentment that comes with age and experience. 

Furthermore, older individuals may have a greater appreciation for the fleeting nature of life, leading them to find joy in moments of stillness and reflection. While young people may seek thrill and novelty, older individuals might find joy in the beauty of everyday moments and the richness of relationships cultivated over time.

In conclusion, the enjoyment of life is subjective and can vary greatly between individuals regardless of age. While young people may revel in the excitement of youth, older individuals can find profound joy in the depth of their life experiences. Ultimately, the key lies in embracing each stage of life with an open heart and a willingness to find happiness in the present moment.",P2,SPA,high,1
"As individuals progress through the stages of life, their perspectives, priorities, and responsibilities evolve. While it may seem that young people enjoy life more than older people due to their freedom, vitality, and fewer responsibilities, I believe that enjoyment of life is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person, regardless of age.

Young people often have more freedom to explore, take risks, and pursue their passions without the constraints of family or career obligations. This sense of liberation can lead to a heightened sense of enjoyment as they embrace new experiences and opportunities. For example, young adults may travel extensively, try new hobbies, and socialize regularly, all of which contribute to a perception of enjoying life to the fullest.

On the other hand, older individuals may find enjoyment in more subtle and meaningful aspects of life, such as spending quality time with loved ones, pursuing personal growth and self-discovery, and appreciating the simple pleasures that come with maturity and wisdom. While they may have more responsibilities and commitments, they also have a deeper understanding of what truly brings them joy and fulfillment.

In conclusion, the notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is oversimplified and does not account for the diverse experiences and perspectives that shape individuals' perceptions of enjoyment.

While it is true that young people may have more energy and enthusiasm, it does not necessarily equate to a greater enjoyment of life.

One reason why older people can enjoy life more is because they have had the opportunity to cultivate meaningful relationships over the years. Strong connections with family and friends can bring immense joy and support as one navigates the ups and downs of life.

"Although it might seems that younger people enjoy life more than older people do , one need to be careful before making such assumption .

Young people certainly for the most part seem to be more extroverted about the ways they pursue experiencing , and having fun .
Perhaps this is the reason why the market is loaded with a plethora of outlets for them to consume and experience `` joy '' or better said `` fun '' .
Nowdays as technology advances there seems to be a never ending industry aimed to providing entertainement for young folks .
This explosion of gadgets and toys certainly can be distracting to the not-so analytical eye and might lead to believe what the statement says .

However , I consider that older people enjoy life as much , if not more than young people because they have reached the maturity for doing so in a more simpler ways ; and because they might have mastered the basic elements that conceive the art of enjoyment at its purest essence .
Certainly the joys of older people tend for the most part to manifest differently from those of the younger crowd .
And therfore being unperceptible to the young and inexperienced eye .
One of the reasons is simply because older people did experience similar `` joys '' when they were young and do not need them anymore .
The other reason is because they might make `` less noise '' about the ways they enjoy life .

Some may say that when older folks were young they did not have all the technological toys that are present today in the market and therefore they could not enjoy life as young people do today .
Certainly , Play Stations , DVD , and MP3 were not around 20 years ago , however , technology such as radio , television , record players , and more that are taken for granted today , were inovative technological `` toys '' thirty and fifty years ago that provided plenty opportunities for the youth of that time to enjoy life .

Certainly , it is much easier to travel today than it was fifty years before , but then most people did not think of it as a way of enjoying life .

One can even go further and try to think about non-western societies where electronic gadgets are not part of everyday life .
There too , young people tend to enjoy life differently than older folks .
Young men might go hunting and young girls might be involved in weaving while elders do n't do these activities anymore .
Perhaps there the difference might be that more often than in our societies , both young and old people gather together to enjoy for instance story telling sessions , where the elders are the main providers of fun and the youngers ones become apprentices of the ways they will enjoy life later on .

"I agree with the statement : ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' , although it was not such an easy question and furtermore it has neither an easy or definitive answer .

I believe that some ( some , because it is impossible to generallyze in abstract themes as this one ) young people enjoy life more than older people mostly because they have less responsabilities .
As it is said : ` Those whom do n't know anything , do n't fear anything ' which means that the less you know the less you have to worry about .
By example , a six year old boy needs to be feed and he worries about it when he feels hungry , buy he does n't worry about who is bringing the money home to buy the food .
So , he enjoys life by being satisfied on his basic needs and by being able to play and experience life at this young stage .

On the other hand , older people , adults for example , generally have an income , they have money , they drive , they have an active social life and they can practically do whatever they want ...
this , gives them a sense of freedom .

I said before that this was not an easy question and either it was not easy to answer because it has many points to be anallyzed , so many that I believe it could be the topic of a professional research .
There are many variables : what can we consider as young people ( teenagers are a young segment of the population and they certainly do n't feel happy alll the time ) and what can be considered as old people ( Very old people are most of the time sick ; according to Jose Saramago : the old people lives going to nothing while the young people goes for everything ) .

But , in conclusion I think that is better to know many things , to be aware of what life has for each one - you can reach this state when you are an adult , even a young adult - and then enjoy life , knowing the advantages and challenges that life puts on your way to get almost anything : when something costs one a lot of work , it will appear to be better when it is obtained .

So that : I am older than other people and I enjoy life more than some younger people .

"In my own personal opinion it is the younger people as opposed to older who tend to enjoy the experiances and occurances of life more frequently .
This most possibly happens because it is the experiances and occurances which are by far more enjoyable than those of an older person .
To my belief this is valid in most cases no matter what culture or circumstances the person is in .

By growing up i have realized that there are three essential things that change as time goes by .
The first and most obvious of these is responsability , the second is the availabilty of time and the third is the situations that we are put in .

As a person grows up it is forced into much more responsible actions .
For example a baby or a very young child would have no responsabilities if not only a few , while as the child emerges into his teens he will inevitably begin to feel the pressure of the responsability which needs to be taken in school and at home .
This becomes even worst when that teenagers finishes school and realizes that he is faced with very important life decisions such as what career to understake , and where to study .
After some time a family would obviously create more responsability , especially as one becomes a parent .

Also spare time begins to decrease as the years go by .
This is directly correlated to the the responsability which one begins to have less as the years pass .
At the very end of high school it becomes evident that it is no longer possible to sit for hours watching to tv due to the amount of work given during those last few years of school .
Or perhaps no longer possible to spend most of your spare time playing with your friends , which at one point in your life appears to be a must daily schedule .

The situations which we face also take a drastic change .
During high school I myself remember wishing each day that it should end as soon as possible .
Nonetheless as i finished i realized how entertaining high school actually was .
In most cases people as they get into college have to undertake a job , which most probably they dont enjoy at all , like myself .
It is hard to describe the frustration that arises in you when you realize you are sitting a pointless job for little money while the children outside are playing all day long .

Perhaps it is important to grow up .
One becomes wiser and much more experianced , this possibly allows people to view life in a different way , and appreciate certain moments more , unlike children who are unable to tolerate any sacrifice or difficult task they have to undertake .
In my case , i wish i had never grown up .
But that is just me .

"When I was young , I used to think that `` older '' people who told me that `` age is mental state '' , that `` you are so young or so old as you feel yourself '' , or similar commonplaces , were either lying or at least looking for emotional justifications or excuses for the fact that , well , they were `` older '' and were not going to be any younger in the future .
As I approach the symbolic `` frontier '' of 30 years , however , and even though I still do not believe that age is only mental , I must accept that I find more respect and understanding for those `` older '' people in my soul .
Moreover , I find myself not only respecting those people but also their opinions , which imply that life does not end when youth ends and , maybe even more clearly , that you can enjoy life as long as your health allows you to and as long as you want to do it .

Right , young people discover everything for the first time , young people live intensively and have the strenght to try out more .
There are no nights like the nights when you discover nightlife , and there certainly is no love like the very first love .
The first travels are especially exciting , and the same could be said about the first serious intelectual enterprises , the first jobs , the first experiences as a financially independent being .

Still , older people who grant this but insist on the advantages of aging definitely have a point .
For , in fact , young people do enjoy life , but they also suffer a lot ( that is why the concept `` teenage Angst '' exists , as well as one of the possible explanation for the popularity of , say , punk music ) .
While the very first love has - for better or worse - an extreme impact , life shows you after a while that suffering related to love only seldom kills people , and that one uses to find other persons to love after a breakup - which is a thing no younger person dealing with an unhappy love story , for example , would even begin to understand .

Besides , the levels of love you begin to feel and to perceive after some years on this Earth are simply incomprehensible to younger people who are still in the process of discovering love - and here I mean not only love between two persons as in a partnership or sexual relationship , but also fraternal love , family-love , friendship , and even love for certain aesthetic artifacts or for certain ideas .
Experience brings a certain detachment with it , it usually involves distance and a decrease - however pronunciated - in passion , but it also implies deeper feelings - you only need to be old enough to notice that they are deeper .

It would seem , thus , that both younger and older people enjoy life , or suffer it , more or less equally - only differently .
The experiences in life are , indeed , so different and so potentially varieted , that it simply would not make sense to try to locate `` joy '' in any given age or life-period .
Young people use to enjoy passionately and as if they were the only persons on Earth , while older people tend to be a little more mature about their own feelings and about their own position in the world .
And this applies to suffering , as well .

So maybe it would be best to forget categorizations based on `` objective '' facts like age and really try to make the best of one 's life regardless of how old one is .
Maybe it would be better to try to enjoy life and to try to make as much other people as possible to enjoy it without caring about people 's age .
Does this mean I am an `` older '' person who is looking for `` justifications '' or `` excuses '' ?
I certainly think this is not the case , but I would let any given younger person to judge , and in the end , I do not seriously care - which could also mean that I have already arrived at this distant maturity ...
Which is OK with me !
As long as it lasts ...

"It 's very hard to generalize who enjoys life more , either young people or older people .
This usualy varies according to each individual 's personality and life story .
However , there are a few ideas and observations that make me assume that older people tend to enjoy life more .

Young people have more energy to live and constantly experience more things .
However , they may get caught up on the velocity of our modern world and not fully enjoy the everyday of their lives .
They have a thirst for something different all the time .
This insatiable craving can distract them from savoring each moment as somethig valuable and enjoyable .

Many times , young people confront difficult situations in which it appears that life is facing its limits .
The bad situations seem graver and can affect the younger mind , not being able to see the long term perspective that an older mind can more likely visualize .

On the other hand , older people live a life with a slower rithm , a life in which they can look back to what they have accomplished and enjoy where they stand today .
Individuals of greater age have more memories , and have experienced more situations , that can put them at ease with their expectations and make them enjoy the little things more than younger people .

Unlike young people , the elder usually have created families , that constantly bring joy to their lives .
The satisfaction of sharing the everyday moments with the poeple one loves , is something that comes with age , when one has had the time to value his beloved ones .

Even though one tends to think that young people are always more enthustiastic towards life and generaly more satisfied , in my experience , it is those who have lived longer that possess the key and secret behind true happiness .

"It can not be made a true statement that young people enjoy lide more than older people do .
Everyone enjoys life in a different way .
Yet , it is true that young people have more energy and willingness to do new things and experiment , that does not mean that they enjoy life more than older people do .
it all depends on one 's view of life , and how is is going to be enjoyed .

For some people enjoying life can be lay doing in the grass in the middle of a forest and observe the sky for the whole day .
However , for other people that could be considered be considered as a boring and even an annoying thing to do ; they would rather go and play soccer .
everything depends on what one likes and one 's view of what enjoying life is .

It is true that young people have less experience and much more energy and wish to do and experiment new things in life , and enjoy experimenting new sensations ; the experience that a mature adult has lets him make it 's own prototipe of what a enjoyable life is like .
Young people are always learning new things and learning comes from experimenting and experiencing new things .
Young people are often considered risky too , since they do n't know much about life and have not matured completely yet ; they enjoy taking risks in life and assuming the consequences is the part that most of the young people do n't like .

From my personal experience i can say that it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

"I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The statement is very vague and general to begin with , and furthermore , it provides no support as to what enjoying implies .

It is not correct to generalize or stereotype such large numbers of people .
Young people , as well as older people , are very different amongst each other .
Some young people enjoy life , while others hate it , and the same happens with older people .
Assuming that generalizing is correct , though , I would still disagree with the statement .

One cannot compare `` apples with oranges '' .
When it comes to young people , enjoying life might mean enjoying going to parties or clubs to dance and meet new people .
When speaking of older people , enjoying life could mean enjoying reading a good book or listening to classical music , or even sleeping !
Even though at first glance a party might sound more fun or enjoyabel than sleeping , the older person might actually enjoy sleeping much more than the young person enjoys partying , and therefore be enjoying life even more .
A past experience with my grandfather illustrates my point perfectly .
I always thought he was very boring and that his life was pretty sad , given the fact that he stayed home most of the time .
However , I once walked into his study where he was just sitting on a couch holding my grandmother 's hand , quietly listening to classical music , and I realized his eyes were watery with emotion .
He was enjoying that moment so deeply it was hard for me to understand , but I realized he simply enjoyed life in a very different way that I did ; not more , not less , simply different .

Furthermore , `` the older the wiser '' explains my disagreement even further .
With experience , people experiment many activities and situations in life , and they learn to identify which ones they enjoy more .
A more experienced or older person has learned over the years to enjoy specifically those things that make them the happiest .
By focusing more specifically on those things that they like , older people enjoy life more deeply .
On the other hand , young people tend to expose themselves constantly to new experiences , and even though there is a thrill to getting to know new things , it is usually with time that one learns to actually enjoy experiences to their fullest .
Young people , in their constant attempt to explore new things , usually dont have time to focus enough to actually get to enjoy things to their deepest .

The statement is a vague and unsuported generalization , which makes it difficult for me to agree with it .
Every person is different , regardless of age , and what one person might enjoy , another might not .
This does not imply that either person is not enjoying life , or enjoying it to a different degree .

"Young people do enjoy life more than older people do .
In my opinion , young people take more chances and risks , as well as they try to experience numerous things when they get a chance .
This because they have been presented more options in life , they are not as careful with their health as older people are , and they like to try new things in every occasion they can find .

Life has evolutionized and changed in many aspects in this last century .
Young people like to take chances and go for what them want .
They tend to look beyond what is presented to them , and go beyond what is traditionally expected .
Sometimes the choice of something new and different may not be there , but young people will look for it , they will expand their horizons and go further out their boundaries .
Old people have more traditions to follow .
Family values are strongly present in their daily lives , so they have to follow certain life styles that young people are not very interested in .

When taking a risk , their is always a fifty percent chance it might work or it might not .
That is what taking a risk involves .
Older people are most conservative and might be more afraid to take a risk .
A young person is starting his or her life , and might see things differently .
They could see their future as an uncertainty for the present time , and might be less skeptical to go for it and take the risk of losing something .
Different than older people , they might not have a family to provide to or worry about .
They might only need to worry about themselves .
The value of things is less important , because it might only have a monetary value , and not a sentimental value .
This because they are young and have not been around for a long time .
Older people might appreciate things more , since they have been here for longer .
They apply more value to things like a bracelet or ring , than just a financial price .
A young person might think that if they lose it , they can replace it from any jewelry store .

Some experience comes from practice .
It can be practice that takes a long time to achieve or simply practice that can be learned quickly by doing it a lot in a short period of time .
Older people are supposed to have more experience than young people .
But it might be in fewer areas .
Young people like to experience new things and try differrent things .
They are more open and know that the world has many different things to offer , so they try most of them or as many as possible .
They are young and healthy , which allows them to travel easier , and eat more ethnic foods .
In the other hand , older people have to take better care of their bodies , since their health is more at risk .

I think that probably younger people have more opportunities to lead a pleasant life , unaware of dangers , economicall worries and age - related illneses ; but I do believe that young people have less wisdom to realize that those opportunities must be well used to get joy in to their lives .

I often see young people overdriven to acomplish things in such a short time , that they cannot possibly realize that they are missing important and joyful experiences on their path .
Young people are more and more feeling the pressure to do a lot , at the cost of enjoying less .
This pressure comes from society , family , their peers , and sadly from themselves , pushing more and more to excel in so many things at the time , that they just end doing everything automatically , without stopping to see what they have acomplished .

Even though older people can be very driven to succeed , years have taugth them that as important as get things done , is the experience of doing them .

I have seen myself stressed and feeling unfulfilled after long hours in a supposedly joyfull experience , as an over planned trip , scheduled by the hour to maximize the eyesightings .
I have also seen my grandfather enjoying himself a lot by just sitting close to the window with a cup of strong tea , reading a magazine or watching the people who pass by the street .

There are pleasures of the older people that cannot compare to some rush and excitement that young people can get from partying all night and leading an accelerated life .
There is the possibility to see the kids grow and become nice people , who will honor the values they where raised in .
And there is of course the possibility to enjoy grandchildren , who can be spoiled by the grand parents while the parents struggle to teach them manners ant get them to bed early .

I also think that older people enjoy more life because they get a sense of a `` job well done '' about their families , jobs or whatever commitment they had in life , whereas young people are still trying to find their purpose .

Older people often have ( or make ) more time , to devote themselves to thing they find enjoyable , as learning something special or talking to people with related interests .
My grandmother spent long hours working two jobs when she was younger to be able to raise her kids , and never had much of a hobby , but now that she has retired , she has found great satisfaction in taking cooking lessons with neighbors that became real friends .

I am finally realizing that life can be more enjoyable than what it has been to me in the past , but this is probably because I am starting to age myself ...
I wonder if as years pass I will find more joy on the little things , and if I will be able to be delighted by seeing the passersby as my grandfather does , but I do think that with age , more things will come too , that will make me very happy .

To summarize , my opinion is that older people enjoy life more than young people , not only because of the oportunities that life present to them , but mainly because of the way they see life .

"I absolutely disagree with the given example .
Older people enjoy life the same or more as young people do .
This is due to the fact , that young people live life according to their expected future , creating this way a false sense of eternity .
Therefore , young people are unable to experience the marvellous mysteries and beauties of daily life .

On the other hand , it is well known , that older people live life more intensive .
Older people are capable of experiencing every second of their existence , because they are aware of their mortal destiny .

Life is based on experiences , life is what we create on a daily basis , but life has an ending .
Life is uncertain , but death is certain .
Everyday responsibilities have made young people , as myself , unaware of the reality of our existince , of the real meaning of life .
Life should not be just about completing assignments and working for a company , life should be something deeper .
But it is well known , that our industrialized society has made out of us working machines , and taken away our freedom to live life accordingly to our decisions .

As one grows , one is taught to be a person who dedicates most of its life to the well-being of the society in which one 's live .
Before , for example in my country , reaching 65 years , one is obliged to work , and one will be able to live only after turning this age .

This is an important reason , that explains why most of the young people are uncapable of enjoying life , the way they should , and why older people are capable to .
It is a pity , that most of the people in our society will start to live life just after having dedicated their entire life to society .
It is during this stage of life , when older people realize that their life is mortal .
It is during this revelation , that people start enjoying life more .
Every second is precious , and every second could be the last .

It is this fact of life that make older people enjoy life more than young people do .

"Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This a commonly held view , but not necessarily a correct one .
Throughout the years , there has been an immense gap created between the young and the old ; emphasized by literature and the media .
However it has not been an accurate representation of life itself .
Even though it is true that younger individuals do hold substantial differences when compared to older ones , different is not a synonym of better or worse .
That is why youngsters do not enjoy life more than older people do , as they simply hold different interests , values , and priorities .

One of the factors that diferentiates the different generations the most is interests .
Younger people tend to be more interested in the new trends , and even follow the current styles in regards to fashion , music , and entertainment .
Older individuals on the other hand , tend to hold on the past , and to be more interested in trends of their younger years .
This difference , however , does not mean that younger individuals can enjoy life to a greater extent , it simply means that some areas , such as personal interests tend to vary with the pass of time .

Another factor that marks a difference between younger and older people , are values .
Younger people seem to live in the moment , and sometimes even avoid the future .
Their values have a tendency to be similar to those of the people of thier generation ; things such as friends , or an education .
However , older people seem to plan ahead much more , and tend to hold the values and morals of thier earlier years .
Values start to modify with th pass of time , and start to modernize .
That is why older people hold more conservative values in comparison to the younger generations .
However , enjoying life has nothing to do with morals , but rather on an individual 's personal level , and that is why it does not mean that older people are lacking a love for life .

Finally , th last factor that differentiates the younger from the older are priorities .
Older people have many more responsabilities , since they have to take care of entire families , and even provide a stable income .
Younger people on the other hand have other priorities , such as completing a proper education , and planning ahead for their future .
It is clear that both parties have apparent differences , mainly because of the coming of age , however it does not mean that younger people enjoy life to a greater extent .

Every individual is different , and they each have thier ways of viewing life .
Most older people tend to have similar outlooks , as younger people do as well .
However , this does not mean that one knows how to enjoy life better than the other , or that one has the right recipe to happiness .
They are merely apparent differences that highlight the diversity that the world possessess .
Because enjoying life varies from person to person , and what might be the correct manner in which to seize life for one individual , might not necessarily work for the next .

"From my own experience , I will have to agree with the idea that older people enjoy life more than younger people do for different reasons such as money , time independance , previous life experience and even wisdom .

People usually say that money can not buy happiness , but i say that money can certanly helps a lot .
Older people usually have paying jobs that allow them to safe money through life , money that a young person can not easily obtain .
One can use money to buy tickets to music concerts , to go to expensive restaurants or even to travel all around the world .
These activities enhance the experience of life .

Time is another good reasong why old people enjoy life more than young people , because when young , someone has activities that can not be avoided .
For example , a kid can not choose to go or not to go to school , the parents do .
Time is an asset that only old people have lots of .
Older people can engage in activities such as art , traveling , cooking and studing because they do not depend of a school or work schedule to live their live by .

Old people also have more experience , a quality that i personally believe that increases the possibilities to enjoy life .
For example , if a young man travels to Paris , he will see thing in a way that may differ from the perspective of an old man .
The young man will probably see only an old city full of old bouilding and museums , but under the experiences eyes of an old man , Paris is full of art , culture and history .
The old man will enjoy more the trip beacuse his years of experience .

Finally , wisdow may not apper to be a good reason to support that older people enjoy life more than others , but i think that wisdow can help a person to take the right decisions in life , this will contribute to a more rich life experience .

"Life is a rollercoaster ride experience , which has its ups and downs , its high peaks and slow curves or falls , which means that each stage of this ride carries with it valuable experiences , each which we have to live at a specific time and period .
I believe both young and older people enjoy life equally the same , the only thing different is that they find themselves in different stages of their ride .
One in which there are franctic curves twist and turns , and the other in the calm and soothing final stage of their ride .

Older people have already experience what was like to be young and wild , to have fallen in love or have their heart 's been broken , while the young are those willing learners wanting to experience life at its fullest , simply because it is their time to wild , being allowed by their young bodies to do so .
Meanwhile older people have already experienced everything they could in their younger years for which they now have a time to reflect and realize that there is no hurry in life , that one as a youngster wish for everything to happen fast .
Which is why nature is wise in giving us that stage in life where we are able to reflect on our past mistakes and give us a final opportunity to mend them .
Therefore getting old is a way of saying that we have to mature , which wisely enough come hand in hand with our physical traits .

Both of these stages in life offer things which the other does n't , one wisdom which a life experience has taught you , and the other the inmense curiosity and uncertainty .
Therefore both of this stages in life have its charms , which appeal differently when being in a certain age .
Therefore while older people rejoice in the comforting feeling of having accomplished their goals , the young search for their own .

However the mere fact of beign old or young does not mean one can can or cannot have an active and wild spirit , being that some young people have what is popularly known as an old soul , being this a way to describe their mature attitute towards the world , whereas older people may still have this child like spirit .
A perfect example of this is my grandfather , who despite the fact of being 76 years old is a very active man , who still loves to play with his grandchildren and will continue to .

In conclsuion I do not belive that younger people enjoy life better than older people , it is simply that they are in two different stages in their life , which therefore means that they both have a different way of appreciating and embracing each and every life 's experience as it presents itself .

"There are several reasons why it is believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Because of their freedom recentely discoverd and the amazing and new oportunities that keep appearing all the time .
Because of this time of exploration that youth has , I can affirm that young people enjoy life more than older people .

Young people feel free to do what they want .
They are in a period of discovering new things and finding out their path and knowing who they really are .
Because old people have already established a life style , with bigger responsabilities , they are not especting anything and their experimental time has passed .

Nevertheless , older people have their own wat to enjoy life , but I can not tell it because I have not experimented the adult period yet .
As a youth , I can affirm that I enjoy life because I take advantage of every new adventure that came out , and I dont have much bigger responsabilities than university .
In addition , university is enjoyable when you learn and at the same time , make friends and have fun with them .
It is the time in which you share your moments of joy with others .

Young people are independiently .
They have the wings to fly werever they want , travell in and outside the country , work in different places only for experience and not because of financial needs .
Youngs aspire for the future and project themself , so they still have hopes and views , and live their life especting and enjoying .

However , not all youngs have a pleasent life .
There are young people in the streets , homeless , and definetely not enjoying life as many other youths .

In conclussion , the adolecense period is fun , but the truth is that each period has their benefits .
Old people find their way to enjoy life too , as well as kids and babies .
The key is in enjoying every moment , because the present is a gift called present .

"Nowadays , there is a strong believe in that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This may be so due to the fact that young people lead more active daily lives , working , going out , having greater physical abilities , among other things .
However , I do not agree with that idea because of the elder 's free time to do as they please and their great wisdom in dealing with life 's problems gained by their life experiences .

Even though we usually think young people 's lives are very active and thus , they are happier and enjoy life better , when you come to a certain age above 65 , you can certainly concentrate on the activities you like doing better .
Young people are always in such a rush , especially in todays ' world in which time is always related to money , that they fail to seize each moment 's priceless value .
Instead , when you become old , your ` working ' time is finished and you usually retire .
It is then when you have the possibility of taking advantage of your free time as well as you please .
For example , if you have always liked reading , now you have plenty of time to spend getting into the great magic world of words .

Another importnant point is that old people have more experience and that helps them worship life better .
When you are young , you always like experimenting new things , no matter the cost .
With every course of action you take , you take risks and then , when watching the consequences of your acts you understand better what life consists of and what really matters to you .
That is what happens to old people .
As they have generally lived and experienced so many things during the course of their lives , at a certain age they seem to know the basics of life and , therefore , do not worry about so many things as you may worry when you are a young adult .
For instance , I have seen my grandmother smiling sympathetically at my very sad experiences - like a break up with a boyfriend - while saying to me ... ` that has happened to me more than once ' and then explaining how life goes on and how there are more important things to worry about .

Even though it is true each one of us has to lead separate lives and the fullfilment of our goals and the reaching of happiness depends on our personal experience , I strongly believe old people enjoy life more than young people do due to their having more time for doing their favourite activities and their enlightening past experiences that show them better paths to succeed in life .
Young adults , therefore , should always take advantage of elder people experience to learn , from very early ages , how life can be always more enjoyable than it already is , always keeping our hearts open to what the voices of experience can share with us .

"Young people might someties be more able to enjoy life than older people because young people have a very important thing in life that unfortunatly elder people do not have ; health .

Young people are normally more capable of doing activities or things to enjoy themselves more because they do not have to deal with as many problems as older people have to deal with .
The stress that older people have to deal with in their life might lead them not to enjoy life as much they want to .
My father once told me something I am never going to forget .
He said that when you are young you have the health and the time to enjoy life but you did not have the money to do so .
And that one had to work hard to earn money , which might cause us not to enjoy life as much .
Then when you are older , between forty and fifty , you had normally made more money , you were still healthy but you no longer had time to do anything to enjoy life as we are supposed to .
Later , when you are old , you had all the money you are going to have and you had all the time in the world , but you no longer had health to enjoy life and have fun .

To my opinion , one has to be able to find the perfect balance between when you are young , older and old .
One has to be able to achieve happiness when you are young by doing things that do not involve to much money .
Later , you have to make sure you are leaving enought time for things such as traveling and family to be able to appreciate life .
And when you are finally old and are normally no longer healthy , you have to be able to enjoy life with what you have left , such as family and friends .

"There is the arguement whether young people or older people enjoy life the most .
Some may argue that older people might enjoy life the most , since they think they are getting older and might die soon .
But I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do for many different reasons .

Young people want to live life to the fullest , and are willing to experience more than older people .
For example the tought of dying is not as present in a young person 's mind as it would be in an older person .
Therefore the young person is more likely to live the moment and not worry so much in the concequences that it might have in the future .
Another reason for arguing that young people enjoy life more , is that a younger person is healthier than an older individual .
By being healthier the person has more mobility , and energy to do more activities , and travel around the word .
Now days there is more technology that young people now how to use to their benefits , making their lives easier , leaving more time for entertaining activities , and leasure time .

Unlike younger people old people 's health as good .
As time passes by the body gets weaker and loses its strength .
There are more older individuasl suffering from a dissease which limitites their mobility , than younger people .
Older people have more thing to worry about that younger people , such as children and bills .
A lot of older people are not used to the technology that is offered now days , therefore most of them might not be encourage to using , and trying new things .

Their health , their stronger bodies , the mentallity , the willing to try new things , and the technology used by young people .
Unlike them older people lack of health and are more resistant to try new stuff .
And for those are the different reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older people .

"I believe that age does n't matter when it comes to enjoying life , it is up to each person to make the best of it and squeeze every drop they can get .
Sometimes when we are young we tend to think that old people had their time and that because they are so worried on their grandchildren , the cold weather , money problems or about their health problems they do n't enjoy life the way young people do .
We believe that age is everything until that a day comes when you look back and think of the great memories you have and the great ones that will still come .

My grandmother was a great example .
She always used to tell me what her life was like when she was a little girl growing up in a small town and moving to a big city , going out with her firends , her curfew and when my grandpfather proposed .
I thought about how great her life was but never thought about how great her life is .
Since we see the present as something common and even unrelevant sometimes I did n't see my grandmother 's life as '' exciting '' let alone fun when she was 60 .
Now , after many other conversations , I got to know that life goes on and that every day is enjoyable , even if it 's your last .
My grandmother goes away on field trips with her friends while I am studying for a never ending test , cooks because she wants to and not because she HAS to , has great stories to tell and always waits for us with a great meal .

Enjoyable gets a different meaning while you are growing up .
When you 're little an ice cream and your mom is everything .
When you get older a toy or a new friend is very important ; when you 're a teenager enjoying life is having friends around you and have something you can identify with like sports ; by college the challange of living alone , traveling , going out to clubs and having a boyfriend/girlfriend is enjoying your youth .
By the time you graduate hopefully you 'll get a good job , marry the man of your dreams and watch your kids grow up .
Every step of the way is enjoyable then .
In my opinion there are no times when you enjoy things more than others , it 's up to you to make every effort for every moment to be worthy and worthwhile .

"I disagree with the statement .
I believe that older people enjoy life much more than younger people do .
There are several reasons why , first of all is that older people have more experience and can have a better idea of what they really want out of life .
On the other hand , young peple tend to be undicided on what they want .

Second , older people knowing what they want , tend to be more appreciate of life since they probably have encountered hardships to get to the point where they can enjoy life .
With young people is the opposite .
They do not have the experience nor have faced as many hardships ( if any ) in life to realize how difficult life can be .

Moreover , older people have worked very hard and have been patient enough to wait and enjoy life .
It is true that young people have more energy and probably are eager to enjoy life but older people have been waiting a long time and they can cherish and enjoy the the moment inmensely when it arrives .
I recognize that older people are more skeptical and less likely to take risks compared with a younger person so the way of life an older person might live is less intense and thrilled with emotion but and older people can enjoy their way of life as much as any young person .

Thirdly , let us not forget that older people were once young people .
They can look back and judge wether they are enjoying life more at an older age than at a younger age .
They probably would come to the conclusion that life is better at a older age just for the fact that they survived and reached an older age .

Finally , older adults certainly are , phisically , older than younger adults , but they can be young adults in spirit .
They can enjoy life inmensely knowing that they had a great life and that the best part is yet to come .

"As older people always say : Times are different now and the past was always better .

When you are a child , you are not afraid because everything is new in this world and your parents are there to support you .
Then , you grow up , you become a teenager and you think life is to LIVE IT AND ENJOY IT , then you are an adult and your responsabilities increase , you have to forget about yourself and think about people around you , and when you are an old person you wish you had more time to do what you never did and always wanted to do , you wish you could have made more mistakes to learn from them but ...
time is gone .

Young people enjoy their lives going to the club , dancing , drinking : this is what they call `` having fun '' .
Older people go to the winery , listen to the music that brings old memories , they enjoy themselves on their own way .
I think both generations younger and older people live their lives the best way they can , they enjoy doing the activities they like and they consider are fun according to their beliefs and their philosophy in life .

The difference lies on the risks they take .
When you are young you feel no fear , you think there is only one life and you have to live it the fullest , you own your world .
But , When you are older , you also know that only one life was given to you , but your pholosophy , your perspective is different because you think since there is only one life to live , you have to appreciate it , take care of it and enjoy it loving and respecting yourself : risks are not the same in each stage of life .

When you are young a risk can be skipping school and that would be very exciting , when you are older skipping class is not fun , it is being irresponsible .

I do not think there is a list of activities to define whether or not someone enjoys life , I think it depends on each one and the way you were raised .
The gift of life was given to us and we can enjoy it the way we want as long as we do not affect other people 's beliefs and lives .

"Life goes by every second of our lives .
As a person gets older , not only his or her body is in constant deterioration , but also his or her mind , ideals , and thoughts .
An elderly can hardly jump the rope or play football , but a teenager can accomplish those tasks with great facility .
Young people can practice a wide variety of activities with little or no limitations .
From parachuting to eating a family-size pizza , the young are always on a better condition , mentally and phisicaly .
Therefore , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This asserttion can be exemplified by a personal experience that I had with my grandfather when I was 14 and with today 's wars .

As a young teenager , I was always able to spend time with my grandfather .
I felt a great respect towards him .
Yet , I was able to regard the differences between us .
I ate hot-dogs and he vegetables .
One day , when we went bowling , he felt on the middle of the lane while slowly throwing the ball .
I panic at that time , but later I apprehended that not everyone is similar .
I was able to discover and to realize that my grandfather could not have fun as easy as I could .
His steps were slow and hardly-accomplished , while I ran in and out of the house .
This experience let me to the belief that when one is old , it is no longer possible to enjoy life much .

Not only I have found experiences of myself for stating that young people enjoy life more than olders do , but society arrangement proves it by itself .
The war that today affects some parts of the world is a clear and vivid example .
Very young people on the Middle East are violentaly in combat .
It is not neccessary a ` fun activity ' , but rahter a way on defending their beliefs and their way of enjoying their life .
It is not often to see a 70-year-old dead by combat means .
The possibilities for a wide of spectrum of activities offered to young people aloud them enjoy the fascination of their lifes .

Life is short and our ` young lives ' are even shorter .
We should discover and take advantage of the inmense possibilities that we have as children and as young adults .
Years are limitants to our capabilities .
Run , jump , swim , and climb today !

"My grandfather was 90 years old when he passed away .
While his life had ended , mine still continued .
However , I could in no way say that he did not enjoy life .
He was one of the most charismatic people I ever knew and if someone had had any experience about life , it was him .
One has to admit that younger people are able to move much faster , and learn much faster , but the truth of the matter is that older people have already learned their lessons , and thus are more able to enjoy life .

Nowadays , youth has the possibility of using technology , which has made life so much more fun , and provided various ways of entertainment such as movies or the Internet .
Also , the fact that we are young in the 21st century allows us to experience much more than our elders experiences during their youth .
As I was telling my friend Mike the other day , there is no way enjoy life without youth .
Precisely the fact that we have not learned our lessons yet , opens up the possibility of discovering new worlds and having new experiences , which our elders simply do n't have at the moment .

While youth does have the added bonus of more time left , older people have the added bonus of their experience .
With time , a person can learn to do new things , find new things , which will simply benefit his or her life .
For example , the fact that my dad has travelled to Paris and knows all the good places there allows him to visit them again and again , something a young person with no travelling experience will not be able to do .
Also , an older person is more likely not to depend on someone economically or legally , which allows them to be freer , than their counterparts : the young people .

In conclusion , I would say that while older people are maybe not as capable of moving as fast as younger people , age does not prevent anyone from enjoying life to the maximum point .
I will always remember my grandfather , anxious to show his experiences and colorful life to his nieces and nephews while continuing to live his live to the fullest .

"In my opinion , and experience , old people can enjoy life as much as the younger .
I belive that people can be of an old age , but still be ` young of hearth ' as far as i have seen is mostly related to how the person lives his life and how he thinks on himself .

Many people belives that to enjoy life one has to be young , the truth is that many of the people that thinks that way will not enjoy life when they get older because of the way they think .
As exanple of this i could relate about my grandmother : from what my mother has told me of her i know she always feared to be old and tried always to hide her age and she did all this because in ther mind she was getting too old to and was afraid of being useless .
I have met other people like her , and aging is not good with them .
In the other hand i have my grandfather : he never cared much for his age and always said he was as the wine : ` getting better with each year ' and is truth , is a sense , since even tought he is 5 years older than my grandmother he is in much more active and seems younger than her .
Constantly we have examples of this kind of person , people that does amazing things even at their advanced age amazing all of us , younger people , that cant do those things .

I Think that also the character of a person is very important , some people are jovial and carefree and if they keep those traits as they get older they will be able to enjoy life as much as they did when they were younger .
For example some people say : ` im 55 years old .
Im too old for those things ' others will say ` im only 55 years old .
Why ca n't i do that ? ' and if they dont see any obstacle in their age then it will not be any obstacle for them and they will enjoy life at its fullest not mattering the age they reach .

"I do not think that it is always the case that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
For example teenagers live at that age a very traumatic period of their lives and normally they hate themselves , hate others , hate their lives , hate everything !
so I definitely do not thing that they enjoy life more than others do .

Young people take risks , I think that is the difference , they want to explore , know , achieve things and sometimes they take their lives for granted .
Yes , sometimes it is true that young people know how to have more fun unlike some older individuals but it does not mean that it is always like that .

Older people have experience , know more about some things , about how life is and I think that the more you know , the more you have experienced life , the more you value things , you stop taking things for granted and give them the right value , you appreciate more because it has taken a lot of effort in order for you to have what you have .
They can enjoy life more simply because they have more memories , either happy or sad but they have them , memories that enrich their everyday life , they have more people to love , more stories to tell , they have lived more .
How would you enjoy life at the most if you have not lived enough ?
If you do not really know how life is ?

Of course there are cases in which older people are bitter , angry at life because they have suffered a lot but that does not mean that more experienced people cannot enjoy their lives as much or even more than unexperienced persons .
It all depends on the way of life you have , how grateful you are , how much love you have given and received , what you have learned in life , etc .
It is definitely not a matter of age , it is more likely , I think , a matter of personality and the circumstances that surround or have surrounded your life .

"Young people in these days have enough energy to do anything they want to , anytime they want it .
First of all because they are healthy and strong so they have no physical limitations .
Furthermore due to the fact that they have not yet experienced a lot in this world makes them hungry to taste every area of life .
Moreover their only role in society is to study and prepare for their future that is the reason why they have no economical , social or family worries yet .
In addition , it is imposed to them that they are `` at the top of their lives '' so it is their chance to do everything they want .
These are the reasons why it is commonly believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
However I do not really think young people of these modern days actually enjoy life , the majority is not mature enough so they run through life experiencing things that they should not experience at young ages and tasting everything as if the world would be destroyed in a few hours .

The fact that older people do not have the energy or health required to party all the time , eat anything they want , run cars , or whatever young people do nowadays , does not mean their life is over and they do not enjoy life anymore .
In fact , I think they have a greater opportunity to enjoy it .
My grandma and my mother are excellent examples of this .
Even though they are not able to do a lot of things anymore due to their age , both are happy women enjoying every minute of parenthood and frienships .
`` There comes a time when you realize relationships are the most important things in your life , more important than objects such as cars , beautiful houses , jewlery , and so on '' , says my grandmother to me all the time .
Furthermore they are so thankful for the wisdom they have acquired through all these years of experiences , that for this reason they enjoy their lives even more every day , as if it where their last one .

"Age is not what determines to what extent we enjoy life , it is our attitude and our choices towards the enjooyments and difficulties we face along the way .
Some of the youthfoul of today think they enjoy life alot more than older people .
This is because they are entering a new stage in their lives were independence and fulfillment rules thier chioces .
They feel they have all the power in the world and what is worst they feel inmortal .
However it is not this two factors or the overwhelment of emotions that will decide how they want to enjoy life at its fullest , it is their own attitude .

A girl that just finished highschool , has all her strength to enjoy the years to come and to achieve her goals , but what if she makes the wrong choices and decides to let her college education pass by and ends up working as a receptionist instead of that mechatronic engineer she wanted to be .

Her whole life was marked by this mediocre attitude .
Instead a girl who has her mind always on track and fights for what she wants , letting go of the common momentary human enjoyments and working towards a rewarding end , will find the obstacles on her road an enjoyment as she defeats them .

This same situation happens with older people .
They think that `` youthfoulness is uselessly spent on the youthfoul '' .
An old rich lawyer may often complain about her deteriorating situation an say that if she could turn back time they would do things differenty , make other choices or aim at higher goals .

The truth is that these inconformity is due , again , by the attitude and the wrong choices she displayed along her life .
On the other hand we also have men and wome who have faced maturity with a smile on their faces .
The experiences rich in their minds were achived thanks to their positive and proactive attitude towards life in general .
So , personally I do n't think that something you have no control of , such as age , can determine to what point you enjoy life .
Life may be enjoyed by a sick 80 year old farmer as well as by a healthy 17 year old waiting at the doors of destiny .

We define how to enjoy life and what it has to offer with our character .

"I do not agree with the statement .
In order to explain this opinion , I will first summarize positive and negative aspects of each life stage , and then draw a conclusion from this evidence .

Young people have several opportunities in their current life stage .
The have health and the vigor that characterizes youths .
They also have access to opportunities in almost every aspect of life : academics , profession , family , spirituality , etc .
They also have support from family members , friends , and colleagues .

Even though youths have these advantages , they have important threats to their possibilities of enyoing life .
Youths worry about their future , planning their carreer , their family , their jobs , etc .
They are also immature to appreciate the special gifs of life , and because of their opportunities , take life for granted .
Finally , they learn through experience , and sometimes these experiences are painful and have terrible consequences .

The elderly , on the other hand , are mature , with a broad baggage of lived experiences .
They can enjoy the fruit of their work and the result of their decisions .
Since they do not have much more to live , they do not take life for granted , and try to enjoy life as much as possible .

Although the elderly have other threats such as sicknesses , deaths in their families and worries of when they are going to die themselves , they have the awareness that their life is short , and they will try to make the most of it .

When comparing the youths ' opportunities and threats to those of the elderly , we can easily find that the advantages of the elderly , in terms of possibilities of enjoying life , are greater .

In summary , young people worry about their future and do not have the time to enjoy their present , whereas the elderly enjoy their present and accept their future .

"I would have to say that I agree with the statement : `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' and here is why :
When you are young ( I would say under 35 ) you have more energy to go around , you definitively have less commitments and responsabilites ( family or work ) , than when you are old , ( over 35 ) you are more of a free spirit .
Please allow me to explain my ideas with some examples .

When I mean you have more energy to go aroung , I am talking about vitality and being in shape , it would not be as easy or comfortable to climb a mountain and camp outdoors when you are in your twenties , when your body is tone and strong .
than when your are in your fifties even if you stay in shape , there is always the risk of a heart attack or other conditions that normally appear with age .
And things that seemed okey before may be uncomfortable or even dangerous now .

As for the commitments and responsabilites , I gravitate towards family and work .
To me these two are the center of my life .
I could not do the things I did in my twenties now that I have a family to support and I am tied with a mortgage and credit card bills .
So I guess I would call this the `` settled life factor '' , which could be pretty tight in both spheres but more manageable when young .

Finally , I belive that when you are young , you are more willing to take risks , go for adventures and take chances as you go .
As people mature they some how change their ways , and settle for something secure which I would translate into a calm life , with much of the enjoyment used already or waiting to be `` used '' during vacation times , maybe once a year .
And as I have heard people say : If I did n't do that when I was young I do n't think I could do it now .

"Young people and older people enjoy their life in different ways .
Some people think that young people enjoy life more than adults , however other people think the opposite .
I will discuss both points of views and finally give my opinion .

Young people enjoy their life in several ways .
Children have fun playing with their toys , they can spend hours playing with them and they do not get bored .
Teenagers like to go out with their friends and also to go to parties .
For example , as a teenager I like to go to the beach with my friends and go to discos and pubs .
Young people also enjoy life when they reach a goal .
For instance , I felt really happy when I won the first place with my friends in a rugby competition .
Children also enjoy and feel happy when they know someone protects them and give them love .

Older people have fun and enjoy life in many ways .
Adults feel happy when they reach a goal or they get something important .
For example , when my father was hired in a very good company in my country he was really glad and I noticed he was enjoying it .
Other way to have fun is travelling , most adults like to travel and meet other people .
For instance , my mother is a person who likes to travel a lot and I always go with her , I enjoy it too but I know thats the way my mother enjoys her life .

Something that is very common is that adults lay on their beds and watch television and they seem to enjoy it , even though some people find it boring .

In conclusion , I think that younger people enjoys life more because there are more moments of happiness while they are children and teenagers .
They have fun in easier ways than older people .
Therefore , in my point of view , children and teenagers enjoy more their life .

"`` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
This is a statement many people from different age groups claim to be true .
But I believe that this statement is not true .

Young people can enjoy life , most of them do .
But the problem nowadays is that all the young kids and young adults have a desire to grow faster and mature earlier in order to be allowed to do more things .
As well , many of them take several things for granted , such as children 's games , situations and experiences that you only experience in your childhood .
They believe that these situations such as climbing the tree or sleeping in a childrens ' house will always be there for them to take .
So they desire to grow up earlier in order to do the things they watch in tv , such as having a girlfriend/boyfriend or going to college .
This fake believe robs them from their true fun , which at their age should be table games , or play station .
For example , my younger cousin who is 9 wants to grow up as soon as possible .
Therefore , he has bought ( with his savings ) things that a grown up should have like a cellphone .
This obsesion to mature has shifted him away of the true enjoyable situations a child should experience .

As maturity comes in a time for everyone , adults know that their time on earth is limited .
Thanks to their previous eagerness to grow up , they did not have the chance to experience all the situations life had to offer .
Hence , this time , they will make time ( if they need to ) in order to enjoy themselves and live life to the fullest .
Although as an adult , one has more responsabilities and concerns , everyone tries to make the time to relax and enjoy life .
This desire for living life to the fullest together with the new oportunities they now have is what allows an adult to finally achieve the joy they 've always been looking for .
As joy is something everyone always desires , they will try to repeat their fun everytime they can .

Overall , the statement that claims that young people have more fun than older people is a fallacy due several facts .
Firstly , younger people try to run past their childhood in order to reach adulthood and have more freedom .
But at this time , they are losing every oportunity to enjoy thier lives .
Secondly , adults now that their time in the world is limited , hence they want to live to the fullest as they can .
The truth is , adults due to their knowledge of life and time , are the ones that enjoy more life .

"I think that younger people do indeed enjoy life more than older people .
In my opinion younger people are supposed to have more fun because they have less responsabilities and do not have to worry as much about problems that come with adulthood , such as money , jobs and family .

I am 17 and I can remember just a few years back when I was 15 , how different my life was .
I did n't have to work , my school works was much less of a burden and I did n't have to worry as much about my future .
Now , only a few years later I realized that my life has changed completly because I now work and at the same time I need to keep my gradees up so that I can get into college .
I realize that from 15 to 17 is not really growing up , and that being a 17 year old is not considerd being an elder , but what Im trying to say that with age comes more and more responsibilty .

Now that I 'm older I see how much time and effort my mom puts in to making my sister and I happy .
My mom constantly looks for work , so that she can make money .
She always has to make sure that my sister 's and my every need is being taken care of .
Sometimes I feel like she might forget about herself .
As my mother works hard like this day after day all I worry about is my school work , my job and what Im going to do next friday .
All I worry about is things for me , while my mom worries about my sister , myself , my animals , my home , her job , her self and many other things .
She has got to make sure that everything is running smoothly .
I cant imagine being her and having to do all those things .
I sometimes wonder , does she ever have fun ?
Does she ever go out ?
The reality is that she does but when she tells me stories about when she was younger she always syas `` ahhh ...
those were the good times . ''
Each time she says that I realize that being an adult can be hard work .

Because I 'm still young I still get to do many fun things , but as I get older peopel around me expect more and more from me and those expectations mean , to act mature and be responsible .
Surely , as I get older I have noticed that my priorities have changed .
I look at my sister , who is a freshman in high school , and see how different we are .
She worries very much about what she wares and what she looks like , while I'de rather worry about getting to school or passing my physics test .
I asked my mom if I was like that and she said `` we all go through it , we all mature ...
its part of adulthood . ''
We all at some point of our lives stop having the same fun as we had as a child .
Look at babies all they do is sleep and eat , while parents wish they could get some sleep or even loose a couple of pounds .

In the end I trully believe that younger people enjoy life much more than older people because they have less ressponsibilities and less things to worry about .
Although throughout your life you are longer an adult than you are a child , you will always remember `` those good old days '' because they are a reminder of when you where care-free and had nothing to worry about .

"In the Western world most people consider that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I have recently been asked if I agree with that line of thought .
Contrary to what most people think , I consider that old people enjoy life more for a number of reasons : they have life achievements to look back to and be proud of ; they can see the influence they exert in their children and grandchildren ; and , they are experienced and see life from another perspective .

Through time older people have experienced positive and negative events .
They have been through moments in life , where everything has been about accomplishments and triumphs , like getting married or becoming a well-known doctor , and others where failure and tragedy , like closing a business or facing a close relative 's death , have played an important role .
However , throughout the years they have learned to balance all these experiences and see that life is beautiful , and that every accomplishment should be a reason to be proud of and every moment should be enjoyed to its fullest potential .

At the same time , older people are able to enjoy the influence they exert in their children and grandchildren , and see the effort they did throughout their life reflected on them .
It is difficult to see a higher pride or degree of accomplishment , than that shown on a grandfather 's face when playing ball with his grandson .
That is a sign of enjoying the little moments of life at their greatest potential , without worrying about the next day 's meeting , or the undone project sitting in front of the computer .

Older people see life from a different perspective than young people do .
And as a famous Latin American poet writes , `` if I lived again I would worry much less about being so careful , about wearing sweaters and always leaving home with an umbrella ...
I would travel without luggage and not be concerned of the day I have to come back ... ''
For these reasons I think old people enjoy life more than young people .
The good news is that we are still young and we can start enjoying life just as all of our grandparents do , taking from them an example for the rest of our lives .
",P2,SPA,high,0
"The world is full of people with a wild range of different personalities , different experiences , and even more diffrent ways of seing life .
Some people enjoy life more than others , but it does not depend on the age of the body .
Therefore , I truly disagree with the statement that says `` Young people enjoy life more than older peolple do '' .

Each age has its own magic , and in every step of our lives we learn and develop abilities that help us to enjoy the time we are living .
For example , when a young child begins to communicate with his or her mother by the use of words , probably feels really proud of it , and enjoy it .
The same happens when a baby starts playing with toys , or a kid learns to read .
This fact can be applyed to adults when they reach their first academic degree or when they get married .

Furthermore , every person has its personal way of enjoying the things he or she does , in addition to a unique form of expressing how he or she feels .
For instance , two humans being can experiment the same situation at different periods of their lives , react to it in a very different way , but enjoy it similarly .

Other fact that is important to have in mind is the concept of joing .
It should vary from one person to another , besides the fact that a person can be having pleasure when other understands that the first one is suffering .
As an illustration , I will state the imagen of a person crying , I can infer that something bad has happened to the person , nevertheless he or she can be crying of happiness .

In conclusion , I believe that each person enjoys life in his or her own way , and would like to add that will be very helpful for humanity to stop looking at situations from a personal perspective and try to understand that each person lives as he or she wants and not to compare between them .

"Young people enjoy life more than older people do , that is what many people think , but I do not agree with it .
Old people can , and they do , enjoy life the same way that young people do , sometimes even more .
The reason I think this way is because , actually I have seen it , I see it everyday of my life , everywhere I look .

Everyday I see old people that go to work , to the movies , and to many othere places young people go and everytime I see a young one next to an old person I always see a smile on the old person 's face .
The reason they enjoy life as much as a young one is because they have lived more , they have more experiences and they are willing to learn new things , because the world we live now is quite different that the one they knew when they were young , so they get surprised .
A clear example : the other day at Christmas dinner I was with my family and my brother gave my grandmother a cell phone with a camera and all the new technology .
My gradmother was happy and surprised , enjoying it , clicking in every button trying to figure out how it works .
In the other hand , my 16 year old cousin , also got a cell phone , but for him it was a normal thing to use , he was not surprise .

This is just an example of my daily life that convince myself that old people do enjoy life , sometimes even more .
The key element why I think this is that old people know they do not know everything so they like to learn new things , a new language , learn how to use a computer or even how to use a cell phone .
They live one day at a time and they hold on to every moment of joy and happiness .
That is something that sometimes young people forget , that sometimes I forget .
I forget to enjoy every moment , to laugh at any time I can , to take a chance to learn something new .
So sometimes I would like to be like and old person , like my grandmother .
I will like to be amazed by simple things , I will like to take one step at a time .

So , no , young people do not enjoy life more than older people .
To enjoy life we have to appreciate every moment .
The important thing to enjoy life is not to do risky things and feel the adrenaline , like a young person will do , but enjoy and learn from every moment , like old people do .

"Wisdom is usually associated with age .
The older we get , the wiser we become .

I agree with this idea because experiences teach us what to do and what not to do .
For example , a child could cut himself by picking up a knife from its blade rather than the handle , but he will learn not to do it again .

In other words , young people do not enjoy life more than young people because they learn through pain .
This does not mean adults do not experience pain , but they know how to avoid it better .
In some way , adults have learned to distinguish the roads that lead to joyful events rather than painful ones .

A perfect example would be the use of alcohol .
Young people tend to binge-drink because they have not learned to distinguish how much alcohol their bodies can tolerate .
On the other hand , grown-ups have already learned this after repeated hangovers , and instead , they learn to experience the taste of a good wine .
Something potentially harmful becomes a pleasure instead .

However , it is not a rosy picture for grown-ups because they have more responsabilities than young people .
Yet , responsabilities usually comes hand in hand with more freedom .
This gift of freedom is not a blank cheque because one has to work hard to earn money and be responsible for oneself .

But on the other hand , kids depend too much on their parents ' time and money .
They may have a lot of fun , but their freedom to move and do as they please is limited .
If kids and teenagers living in big cities want to go to the movies , they usually need their parents to drive them to the cinema .
They could do it alone by bus , but parents are sometimes afraid something could happen on the way .

To sum up , youger people do not enjoy life more than older people because as the years go by , one acquires independence and experience .
These two elements in my value system are not a magic keys to instant happiness but they are keys for doing whatever makes us happy without falling into painful situations .

"In my point of view I completely disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
In my country , everyone enjoys life as much as possible and for them they do not care about their age .
For them age is just a number ; they think that the spirit that is within themselves is what matters .
So they enjoy their lives to its maximum in any period of time .
And so , do i .

Besides , everyone has many goals , and one of them is to enjoy life .
So no matter what age you are you can enjoy life .
For instance a child could be thinking that he is enjoying life when he/she is playing with his/her friends , now let 's see a old person having a vacation on the Bahamas spending his/her time with the person that he/she loves .
In my point of view , both people , the child and the old person are enjoying life , and i do not see why would one of them enjoy life more than the other .

As i said before everyone has a spirit and i personally do not think that the spirit get older as the days pass by .
Within one 's spirit there is energy .
Energy is what takes us from one place to another ; to eat or not to eat ; to do things or not to things ; to enjoy life or not to enjoy life .
So then , if everyone has a spirit that means that they also have energy , therefore everyone has an equal amount of energy to enjoy life at any period of time .
To put in other words , age does not matter for someone to enjoy life .

In conclusion , young people do not enjoy life more than older people do because we are all the same .
It is true that when you get older the muscles start to be more flexible and solf and tends to break more easily than if you were young .
But muscles do not have anything to do with enjoying life .
It is also true that as you get older , your brains develops in different steps and so you can think more deeply about things that interest or bother you .
But does that affect whether you enjoy life more than others ? .
Well , in my opinion my answer would be no .

"Title: The Importance of Youth Engagement in Community Service

In today's fast-paced world, it is often argued that young people do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities. However, I disagree with this statement. Young people today are actively engaged in various forms of community service, although it may not always be visible or traditional in nature.

One reason for this misconception is the changing landscape of community service. Young people are utilizing technology and social media to raise awareness, fundraise, and volunteer remotely. For example, online platforms like GoFundMe and volunteer matching websites have enabled youth to support causes they are passionate about from anywhere in the world.

Moreover, many young people are engaged in advocacy and activism to address social issues at a systemic level. They participate in protests, sign petitions, and engage in social media campaigns to bring attention to important issues such as climate change, racial justice, and gender equality.

Furthermore, schools and universities are increasingly emphasizing the importance of community service through service-learning programs and extracurricular activities. These initiatives not only benefit the community but also provide valuable learning experiences for young people.

In conclusion, while it may appear that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities in traditional ways, they are actively involved in making a difference through modern forms of community service, advocacy, and activism. It is essential to recognize and support these diverse efforts to empower the next generation of community leaders.",P3,SPA,high,1
"In today's fast-paced world, it is often argued that young people do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities. However, I disagree with this statement. While it may seem that young people are preoccupied with their personal lives, social media, and academic pursuits, many are actively engaged in various community service activities.

One reason for my disagreement is the rise of social awareness among young people. With the increasing access to information and the prevalence of social issues in the media, young individuals are becoming more conscious of the problems facing their communities. This awareness motivates them to take action and contribute towards positive change.

For example, I have witnessed firsthand the efforts of a group of young volunteers who regularly organize clean-up drives in their neighborhood park. Despite their busy schedules, these individuals make time to gather and work together towards improving the environment for everyone to enjoy.

Moreover, many schools and universities now incorporate community service into their curriculum, encouraging students to participate in various projects and initiatives. This not only allows young people to give back but also instills in them a sense of responsibility towards their communities.

In conclusion, while it may appear that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities, the reality is quite the opposite. With a growing sense of social responsibility and increased opportunities for engagement, young individuals are actively involved in making a positive impact on their communities.",P3,SPA,high,1
"In today's fast-paced world, the notion that young people do not dedicate enough time to serving their communities is a topic of debate. While some argue that the younger generation is more self-absorbed and less inclined to volunteer or engage in community service, I believe that this perception is not entirely accurate.

Firstly, it is essential to consider the various ways in which young people contribute to their communities. In an age where social media and technology dominate daily life, many young individuals are using these platforms as tools to raise awareness about social issues, mobilize support for causes, and connect with like-minded individuals to effect change. The impact of these virtual community efforts should not be underestimated.

Moreover, the traditional forms of community service, such as volunteering at local shelters, organizing charity events, or participating in clean-up drives, may not always be visible or quantifiable. Many young people are juggling academic responsibilities, extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, and personal commitments, making it challenging to dedicate extensive time to community service.

Furthermore, the definition of community involvement has evolved over time. Young people are increasingly involved in advocacy work, lobbying for policy changes, and engaging in social entrepreneurship as a means of addressing systemic issues in society. These forms of community engagement require strategic planning, networking, and collaboration, which may not always translate into visible, immediate results.

In conclusion, while it may appear that young people today are not giving enough time to helping their communities in traditional ways, it is crucial to recognize the diverse and innovative ways in which they are making a difference. Rather than solely focusing on the quantity of time spent on community service, we should also acknowledge the quality and impact of their contributions.

"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In today's fast-paced world, many young individuals are preoccupied with their personal pursuits and responsibilities, leaving little room for community involvement. One reason for this trend is the increasing focus on individual success and achievement in contemporary society. With the pressures of academic performance, career advancement, and personal goals, young people often prioritize their own needs over those of their communities.

Furthermore, the rise of technology and social media has also contributed to the decline in community engagement among young individuals. Spending excessive amounts of time on screens can lead to a sense of detachment from the physical community and reduce opportunities for meaningful interactions and contributions.

Moreover, the lack of awareness and exposure to community issues and initiatives may also play a role in young people not dedicating enough time to helping their communities. Without proper education and encouragement to participate in community service activities, many young individuals may not realize the importance and impact of giving back to their communities.

For instance, volunteering at local shelters, participating in environmental clean-up efforts, or organizing charity events can foster a sense of connection and social responsibility among young people. By actively engaging in community service, young individuals can make a positive impact, develop empathy and compassion, and contribute to creating a more cohesive and supportive society.

In conclusion, while there are various factors influencing the lack of community involvement among young people today, it is essential to emphasize the importance of giving back and fostering a sense of social responsibility.

Many volunteer at local shelters, participate in environmental clean-up events, and engage in fundraising activities for charitable causes.

Platforms like GoFundMe and VolunteerMatch connect young volunteers with opportunities to contribute their time and skills to various causes. This has made it easier for young individuals to get involved and make a positive impact in their communities.

In conclusion, young people today are actively involved in community service and are passionate about creating positive change.

"In today's fast-paced world, it is evident that many young people do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities. This lack of involvement can be attributed to several factors.

Firstly, the rise of technology and social media has consumed a significant amount of young people's time and attention. Rather than engaging in community service or volunteer work, many youths spend hours on end scrolling through social media platforms or playing video games. This shift in priorities has led to a decline in the amount of time young people are willing to commit to community service.

Secondly, the competitive nature of modern society has placed a heavy emphasis on academic and career success. Many young individuals are focused on building their resumes and securing lucrative job opportunities, leaving little room for community involvement. The pressure to excel academically and professionally often takes precedence over giving back to the community.

Furthermore, the breakdown of traditional community structures has also contributed to the lack of youth engagement in community service. With families becoming more dispersed and communities becoming more fragmented, young people may not feel as connected to their local communities and therefore may not see the importance of giving back.

In conclusion, it is clear that young people nowadays do not prioritize helping their communities due to the distractions of technology, the pressures of academic and career success, and the changing dynamics of community structures. It is essential for young individuals to recognize the importance of community service and to make a conscious effort to allocate time towards giving back to their communities.",P3,SPA,high,1

Let me say some of the reasons that support my decision : Since there are more innovations and new thing coming in , the young peolpe spend their time doing things that in the near future do not contribute with the development of their community .

As an example I would like to say some examples about what the young peolple of my country do at the moment and what the young peolple did before .

I remembered when I was at the school , the teachers took us to different places of the city in order to do social activities with the poor people , we braught them food , toys , clothes , and it was really satisfactory for all of us .
In addition to all this activities , at the end of the school , I mean in the last year , we had to do a social project whit the community and it was a part of the grades at the end of the year , but anyway we did that for other reasons ... `` help the people '' .
However , after to have finished the school , I still carry on with this kind of activities and some of friends also do that yet .

On the other hand , when I look at the young people now , I get surpriesed how the life change and how the activities that we used to do it before do not exist right now .
What the zoug people are interested in ? ...
Go to the disco , play x/box , playstation , internet , watching T.V , etc. and some others activities that do not contribute with the integral formation of the person .
I think that much of the behaviours the young people have , are coming from the rapidly change of the world .
However we can not forget that we do not live alone , we live with other people that probably need our help and we have not realised yet ..

"A major feature in which we , the youth , differ from our predecessors , is in the amount of time we use in order to help our communities , which in some cases is none .
Multiple reasons are alleged , some say they lack of time whereas others accept they are to selfish to help others without a vested interest .

It is true that nowadays young people are always rushing to and fro , since due to the competitive world we live in , we have really tight schedules .
In addition to this , if you bear in mind a youth cannot afford most of the times to live close to our workplaces , you have to count with the commuting times .
For example I leave home at eight o'clock each morning and do n't come back until eleven in the night .

Sometimes it is not only a matter of time but of upbringing .
If a person has n't been taught to be generous , you ca n't expect from him or her to share his or her time for a certain task , eventhough when he or she understands it would benefit his or her community .
It is a fact that moral values are decreasing and that a solution has to be found .
I am perfectly aware of how difficult is to handle this problem , since my 15-year-old brother has plenty of time and although both me and my parents keep constantly encouraging him to do something for others , it has really no effect .

Fortunately , there is people whose work is mainly focused on providing those types of services to the community , but this should n't deter us from trying to improve ourselves , that 's it , to reschedule or find a bit of time during the weekend and to bear in mind that the next generation will behave accordingly to what we teach them .
",P3,SPA,high,0
"While it is always difficult to make such strong claims and there are for sure some exceptions , I overall agree with the statement .
We are living today in a much more individualistic society than twenty years ago .

I believe that the underlying reason is mainly economic .
Decades ago young students could aim for fairly reasonable job and access to decent housing without caring too much about their career .

The situation is very diferent today .
The list of requirements of accessing a good university , and ultimately a good job , is endless : languages , experiences abroad , extra-scholar activities related to your field , good grades to pass the increasingly selective filters , a renowed MBA , etc .
Competition is getting harder and students have little time left else than for carefully planning their curriculum and career in order to outperform their peers .

When I was a student , I for example added to my morning classes at the university extra daily classes in German and French , and used my summer breaks to travel abroad to hone my fluency in these and other languages .

I had obtained the degree of Camp Counselor and used it a couple of times in camps with less afluent children .
It was very rewarding from a personal perspective , but I decided to focus on my language skills .
Now with perspective , I wish I had helped more .

I know that the situation is changing now and presenting extracurricular social activites may represent valuable earning points in the selection process at some universities and even with some employers .
These experiences are a way of distinguishing the individual from the rest and stressing his or her personal value .

I believe that government should encourage social activites by proposing alternatives which let students help the community while reinforcing their curriculum .
As for example exchange programs where young people could help local communities abroad , honikng their language skills and at the same time fulfilling their wish to help out .
I know now that these possibility exists , but the role of institutions is to promote them .
Should I have know about them , I had not wasted the opportunity !

"Nowadays there is great controversial over the time young people spend helping their communities .
Many years ago , it was very common seeing young people helping their communities in activities such helpings in churchs , schools and so on , during last years old people have noticied it has decreased the number of youths who help their communities .

From my point of view , it is a matter of fact that the number of young people who helped in their communities has decreased in last decade .
For instance , when i went to my church ten or fifteen years ago me and my friends helped to do all the things that the preacherman could not do by himself ; but as we have grown up there are no young peolpe who help in church and , in fact , the elder ones are those who help the preacherman in order to go on with the mass .

There are many reasons that can help to understand this problem .
In the first place young people are so ineterested in new technologies that they are forgetting so important values such as family or friends .
What i mean is that they spend so many hours playing with computers or watching TV that they forget what is really important in life which , i believe , is the people around you including family , friends and , of course , your community .
It is obvious that if you do not care about your family you will not care about your community .

On the second place , we live in such a competitive society that parents do not spend enough time with their children to educate them in the same as they were educated by their eldests .
As a result , young people have not received the learnings of helping those around them .

If you ask to me , i think that the lack of help from young people is an important problem because it is producing a great seperation between the young and old people in their communities , and the only way to resolve it is give a better education to the little ones in order to avoid this problem in the future .
",P3,SPA,high,0
"There are several reasons why I think that young people nowadays give enough time to help their community , most of them based in my own personal experience , that makes me completely disagree with the statement setted .

In first place , we have to distinguish between periodic help to the community and flunctuant help to the community .
The first one is help of young people almost in a weekly basis and with a very high grade of compromise .
The second one is help given when certain natural disasters such as tsunamis or floodings arise .

Looking back throughout what I have been witnessing in this particular topic during the last 10 years , it is pretty clear for me that young people are involved in their community in a periodic basis .
Just a small example of this may be a program hold in my University which consists on young people living with old people who live alone and need help .
Of course there is an advantage for the young people from the program such as not having to pay a rent , but the really important thing of this program is that they are helping the community , helping the old people , helping their families and in general , helping society to become much more involucrated in the needs of the community .

There are also many examples of non periodic help such as those of natural disasters .
When that happens you always see plenty of young people moving to get food or clothes but not only in their own countries , but also moving themselves to wherever the disaster has occurred .
An example of this is the Tsunami held in Asia a couple of years ago , again in my university , you could see every single student organization moving in order to get money , food , clothes or medicines .

So , to sum up and as I have argued before , young people make lots of efforts to help their communities and they really give many of their free time to help others .
",P3,SPA,high,0
"Giving enough time to help communities is an issue that has being of interest lately , specially in what regards to young people .
It is believed that young people nowadays do not spend enough time in this activity as they should .
Even though many youth organizations have been borned in the few couple of years many others have mostly dissapeared .
Moreover , there has been an important change in life style during the last decades which has modified the availability of time for this activities .

On one hand , there is evidence that this statement is not true .
We have observed over the last couple of years an important increase in the number of youth organizations which try to cover this necesities and perform this tasks .
Many young people get enrolled in them and try to help others , mostly in an anonymous way .
In what regards to my country , I can think of several different organizations that try to encourage succesfully young people to get involved in their communities .

On the other hand , it is true that organizations encharged of this type of activities excisted before , mainly related to churches or to religous beliefs .
During the last decade , the sentiment of religious involvement has fallen drastically and young people nowadays do not usually relate to this groups .
Therefore , while it is true that many youth groups which try to cover this neccesity have arised during the last couple of years , they are mostly covering the empty space left by religous groups .
In the same sence , young people nowadays have less time to devote to this type of activities , since personal careers have becomed more demanding .
For instance , in many countries fifty years ago women did not use to work or study and while they were young they usually took care of helping their communities .
Nowadays , young women have a professional career as busy as man do .

As a conclusion , I believe that even though it is true that young people spend less time helping their communities compared to what young people devoted to this activities fifty years ago did , is also true that young people 's life has changed drastically and there has been an important reduction in the amount of available free time to perform them .
Therefore , I do not agree to the statement , since the word enough is not proper for this context .
Young people devote less hours but it may be enough given the amount of free hours they have left after taking care of all their responsabilities .
",P3,SPA,high,0
"Today 's youth is a busy and stressed one .
Too busy to interact with their communities and their surroundings .
Young people have responsibility such as school and afterschool activities as well as the desire to have a social life .
It is because of these elements that I agree that young people nowadays to not give enough time to helping their communities .

As a highschool 12th grader , I must admitt that the mayority of people my age to not have time to help their communities .
School is a hectic responsability and homework is increased throughout the year .
When I have time off , I need to work on future homework assignments or on organizing my time for the other responsabilities that I have prioritized as more important than my community .

Another element in young peoples lives that takes away from helping the community , is afterschool activities .
As an avarage highschool student , I take swimming classes afterschool or help the student council set up school events .
If i am not working for the school or for my physical being , than i am in town practising for my SATs .
I spend most of my weekdays worrying about my grades and my reponsabilities as a grade representative , than wondering what i could do to help the community .

Once school and afterschool events are over , I use my weekends to relax and go out with my friends .
Young people nowadays do n't really care about the community and rather worry about their own problems .
If you ask young people what they find most important you will realize that their answer is selfish , in that it only thinks about themselves , because they only have time to worry about themselves .

In conclusion , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities out but , it is only because we lack the time to do something about it .
If our lives were more organized and less occuppied , perhaps an interest in helping our communities would surface .
",P3,SPA,high,0
"Young people nowadays definitely do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This is clearly reflected in modern society where everyone is busy taking care of his/her own problems and very few people have the kindness of caring a little bit more about the people around them .

There are two kinds of young people that should be considered .
On the one hand , there are those who do not care about the community where they live in , they are so busy doing their things , enjoying themselves or getting into trouble that there is no way they would have time to think about their community .
These people live their lives centered on themselves and are most commonly seen among us .
They do not want to do it because they would rather use their time and money doing things that would benefit themselves , which is probably the most obvious thing to do .
This selfishness is one of the main components of the human being that is almost impossible to eliminate .
Even if they had enough time or money , they would surely find something to spend it on and not dedicate it to helping the community .

On the other hand , there are those who really wish to help the community .
They are rare , but not extinct .
They are usually those who have a little more spare time to dedicate to things other than themselves and probably the economic power to do it .
Spending more time and resources on the community would mean having less left for themselves , something that not many people can really afford because these young people usually have to study , go to school , or even work !

I personally believe it all resides inside of us , in the desire to do it or not .
Even when under bad circumstances , as long as you have the will , there is nothing that can stop you .
But if the will is not present , no matter how much time or resources you have , you will always need it for something else .

"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements are crafted with the primary goal of enticing consumers to buy a product or service, often by highlighting its best features and downplaying its drawbacks. This can create a misleading image of the product in the minds of consumers.

One reason for this is the use of clever marketing techniques such as selective editing, exaggerated claims, and persuasive language to create a sense of desire and urgency in the audience. For example, a fast-food commercial may showcase a perfectly crafted burger with fresh ingredients and vibrant colors, but the actual product received by the consumer may look vastly different in reality.

Furthermore, advertisers often use celebrities or influencers to endorse their products, creating an association between the product and a desirable lifestyle. This can manipulate consumers into believing that purchasing the product will elevate their status or make them more attractive, even if the product itself does not live up to these expectations.

In conclusion, advertisements are designed to sell a product, and as such, they are inherently biased towards presenting the product in the best possible light. Consumers should approach advertisements with a critical eye and be aware that the reality of a product may not always match the idealized image portrayed in advertisements.",P4,SPA,high,1
"Advertisements have a unique way of presenting products in the best possible light, often making them appear much better than they really are. As a consumer, it's easy to fall into the trap of believing that a product will solve all our problems or drastically improve our lives based on what we see in advertisements.

One reason why advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits of products is that their main goal is to sell. Advertisers use persuasive techniques such as emotional appeals, celebrity endorsements, and misleading claims to capture our attention and convince us to make a purchase. For example, a skincare product might promise flawless skin in just a few days, even though achieving such results is highly unlikely.

Furthermore, advertisements often focus on the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or completely ignoring any potential drawbacks. This one-sided portrayal can create unrealistic expectations among consumers and lead to disappointment when the product fails to deliver as promised.

"In today's consumer-driven world, advertisements play a significant role in influencing our purchasing decisions. But do these advertisements truly represent the products as they are, or do they simply create an illusion of perfection? I firmly believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the qualities of products, making them seem much better than they actually are.

One reason for this is the use of clever marketing tactics and persuasive language to captivate consumers. Advertisers often use hyperboles and superlatives to highlight the positive aspects of a product while downplaying its limitations. For instance, a shampoo commercial may claim to make your hair ""shinier than ever,"" but in reality, the results might not be as miraculous as portrayed.

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on carefully curated visuals and editing techniques to create an idealized image of the product. Have you ever noticed how food in commercials looks incredibly appetizing and perfect, but when you order it in real life, it hardly resembles the picture? This manipulation of visuals can mislead consumers into having unrealistic expectations.

Moreover, endorsements by celebrities and influencers further contribute to the inflated image of products. When a famous figure promotes a product, it automatically adds a level of glamour and desirability, regardless of the product's actual quality.

In conclusion, while advertisements serve the purpose of promoting products, it is essential for consumers to approach them with a critical eye.

"I agree that most advertisements tend to portray products in a more favorable light than they actually are. Advertisements are meticulously crafted to highlight the positive aspects of a product while downplaying any potential drawbacks. Companies invest significant resources in marketing campaigns to create a perception of desirability and superiority around their products.

One primary reason for this phenomenon is the competitive nature of the market. Companies strive to outshine their rivals and attract consumers by presenting their products as the best choice available. This often leads to exaggeration and embellishment in advertisements to capture the attention of potential customers.

For example, cosmetic advertisements frequently use editing techniques to enhance the appearance of models' skin or features, creating an unrealistic expectation of the product's actual effectiveness. Similarly, fast-food commercials showcase mouth-watering images of their products, despite the reality often falling short in terms of taste and quality.

Moreover, the rise of influencer marketing has further blurred the lines between authenticity and exaggeration in advertising. Influencers are often paid to endorse products, leading to biased and misleading representations that may not reflect the true nature of the product.

Firstly, reputable companies understand the importance of maintaining credibility and integrity in their advertising. They invest in thorough research and development to ensure that their products meet the claims made in advertisements. For example, pharmaceutical companies must adhere to strict regulations to accurately represent the benefits and risks of their medications in advertisements.

Secondly, consumer protection laws exist to prevent false advertising practices. Advertisers can face legal consequences for making misleading claims about their products. This serves as a deterrent for companies to provide accurate information in their advertisements.

Moreover, in today's digital age, consumers have access to a wealth of information and can easily research and compare products before making a purchase. Misleading advertisements would ultimately harm a company's reputation and lead to negative consumer reviews.

One key reason for this phenomenon is that companies aim to maximize sales and profits, leading them to highlight the positive aspects of their products while downplaying or omitting any negatives.

Moreover, advertisements frequently use persuasive techniques such as emotional appeal, celebrity endorsements, and catchy slogans to create a positive image of the product in the minds of consumers. For example, a fast-food commercial may showcase a perfectly crafted burger, but the actual product received by the customer may look vastly different in reality.

Another factor contributing to this discrepancy is the use of editing and special effects in advertisements to enhance the appearance of products. For instance, beauty and skincare ads often feature models with flawless skin, which may not accurately represent the results achievable by using the advertised products.

In conclusion, the primary goal of advertisements is to sell products, and this often involves presenting them in the best possible light, even if it means exaggerating their benefits or concealing their drawbacks. Consumers should approach advertisements with a critical eye and conduct thorough research before making purchasing decisions.",P4,SPA,high,1
"Advertisements are a powerful tool used by companies to persuade consumers to buy their products. However, I firmly believe that most advertisements do indeed make products seem much better than they really are. This is often achieved through clever marketing strategies that highlight only the positive aspects of a product while downplaying any potential drawbacks.

For example, cosmetic ads often use heavily photoshopped images of models to promote their products, creating unrealistic expectations of what the products can actually achieve. In reality, the results may not be as dramatic as shown in the advertisements.

Similarly, food commercials showcase mouth-watering dishes that look perfect in every way, enticing viewers to purchase the product. However, the actual product may not live up to the tantalizing image portrayed in the ad.

Moreover, car advertisements often emphasize speed, luxury, and performance, but fail to mention potential maintenance issues or hidden costs associated with owning the vehicle.

In conclusion, most advertisements are designed to create a sense of desire and urgency in consumers, often through exaggeration and selective presentation of information. It is essential for consumers to approach advertisements with a critical eye and not be swayed solely by the enticing imagery and promises made in these commercials.",P4,SPA,high,1
"In the world of marketing, the primary goal of advertisements is to entice consumers to purchase products or services. However, it is not uncommon for advertisements to present products in a way that makes them appear significantly better than they really are. This practice raises the question: do advertisements truly reflect the reality of products, or do they simply create an illusion to boost sales?

One reason why most advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are is the use of exaggerated claims and hyperbolic language. Advertisers often resort to catchy slogans and superlatives to grab the audience's attention. For instance, a simple cleaning product may be marketed as ""the ultimate solution to all your cleaning needs,"" creating an unrealistic expectation in the minds of consumers.

Moreover, advertisements frequently rely on carefully curated visuals and editing techniques to enhance the appeal of products. Bright colors, flawless models, and glamorous settings can make even mediocre products seem luxurious and desirable. How often do we see fast-food burgers looking picture-perfect in ads, only to receive a sad, squished version in reality?

Furthermore, the selective presentation of information in advertisements can mislead consumers about the actual effectiveness or quality of products. For example, a skincare product may highlight its ability to reduce wrinkles but conveniently omit any mention of potential side effects or limitations.

Therefore, it is evident that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the qualities of products, making them seem much better than they truly are. While this marketing strategy may be effective in driving sales, it can also lead to disappointment and distrust among consumers who feel misled. The next time you see an ad making bold claims, ask yourself: is the product truly as amazing as they say, or is it just clever marketing at play?",P4,SPA,high,1
"It is undeniable that most advertisements have a knack for portraying products in the best possible light, often making them seem much better than they truly are. This practice is not only common but also an essential aspect of marketing strategies aimed at capturing consumer attention and driving sales.

One reason for this phenomenon is that advertisements are carefully crafted to highlight a product's strengths while downplaying its weaknesses. For instance, a fast-food commercial may showcase a juicy burger with perfectly melted cheese, but fail to mention its high calorie and sodium content. By focusing on the positive attributes, advertisers create an appealing image that may not necessarily reflect the product's actual qualities.

Moreover, the use of persuasive techniques such as exaggerated claims, selective editing, and celebrity endorsements further contribute to the embellishment of products in advertisements. For example, a skincare ad featuring a flawless celebrity complexion may lead consumers to believe that using the product will guarantee similar results, despite the reality being far more nuanced.

In conclusion, while advertisements play a crucial role in promoting products and influencing consumer behavior, it is essential for consumers to approach them with a critical eye. By understanding that most advertisements aim to create a desirable image rather than provide an accurate representation, individuals can make informed purchasing decisions based on their own research and judgment.",P4,SPA,high,1
"I strongly disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. While it is true that some ads use persuasive techniques to highlight the positive aspects of products, it is not accurate to claim that they grossly misrepresent the reality of the products. 

Advertisements play a crucial role in informing consumers about the features and benefits of products. They aim to attract the attention of potential buyers by showcasing the unique selling points of the products. For example, an ad for a new smartphone may emphasize its advanced camera technology and long-lasting battery life, which are genuine aspects of the product.

Moreover, the advertising industry is governed by regulations that require ads to be truthful and not misleading. Companies can face legal consequences for false advertising practices. This serves as a deterrent for businesses to provide accurate information about their products in ads.

In addition, with the rise of social media and online reviews, consumers have more access to information and can easily verify the claims made in advertisements. If a product fails to live up to the promises made in an ad, customers are quick to share their experiences, leading to a loss of trust in the brand.

In conclusion, while advertisements may highlight the best features of products, they do not make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements serve as a tool to inform consumers about products and should be viewed as a way to make informed purchasing decisions.",P4,SPA,high,1

Advertisements are carefully crafted to highlight the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or completely ignoring any potential drawbacks. This practice is done to create a desire for the product in consumers and ultimately drive sales.

One of the main reasons advertisements make products seem better than they are is through the use of persuasive language and imagery. Advertisers often use exaggerated claims and flashy visuals to capture the attention of consumers and create a sense of urgency to purchase the product. For example, a fast-food commercial may show a perfectly crafted burger that looks nothing like the actual product you receive when you order it.

Furthermore, advertisements often focus on the benefits of a product without providing a balanced view of its limitations. This can mislead consumers into believing that a product will solve all their problems or fulfill all their desires, when in reality, it may fall short of their expectations.

These ads create unrealistic expectations about the results that the product can actually deliver. For example, a skincare ad may show a model with flawless skin, implying that using the advertised product will lead to similar results. In reality, achieving the same level of perfection may require additional treatments or editing beyond what the product alone can provide.

Another way advertisements can exaggerate product benefits is through selective editing or staging. Food commercials, for instance, often use tricks like adding shaving cream to a scoop of ice cream to make it look more appealing on camera. This can mislead consumers about the actual quality or quantity of the product they will receive.

Advertisements are carefully crafted to highlight a product's best features and downplay any flaws it may have. The use of clever marketing tactics, such as using attractive models or exaggerated claims, can create a false sense of desirability around a product. For example, a fast-food commercial may show a perfectly styled burger that looks nothing like what is actually served in the restaurant. This manipulation of reality can lead consumers to have unrealistic expectations about a product's quality or effectiveness.

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to create a sense of urgency or FOMO (fear of missing out) among consumers. This can pressure individuals into making impulse purchases without fully considering whether the product meets their needs or expectations.

Overall, while advertisements serve an important purpose in promoting products, consumers should approach them with a critical eye and not take everything at face value.

Moreover, the use of clever marketing tactics and manipulative techniques can create a false sense of need or desire for a product. Advertisements often employ emotional appeals and aspirational messaging to evoke strong reactions from consumers. This can lead to unrealistic expectations about the benefits or performance of a product.

"The development of competition between companies have created a war in the area of advertisements .
Nowadays , more and more advertisements have develop new strategies to catch the customer 's attention , although they are not as they appear ; in other words , producers of advertisement have had to improve their strategies being more and more creative and original , and even , trying to sell products that seem to be better than they really are , but they are not good enpugh .
And that is because , in my opinion , there are n't regulations that help the customers to valid their rights and to select the proper products without the influence of adverstisements .
I think , goverments have to create , not only new regulations to the companies , but also new instances where people who have purchased something wrong can demand for their rights .
That means , goverments have to create politics that regulate what advertising companies are doing and how they have to respond to thier customers .

On the other hand , not only advertisers are culpable in this topic , customers have the responsability to buy things that we really want , and realize that the last purpose of the adverstisements is to sell as much as they can , and not to think in the really needs of people , or in the capacity of customers to pay for that .
So , if you want to buy something , it is your responsability to see and select the correct product .
Although , advertisements can show you different products with their advantages and occult disadvantages , you have to be sbut at the end you are who have to select and buy what you really want and need .

Finally , if you want ot buy a product , try to think about what you really need and do n't pay attention of what advertisements give to you , because most of the time you do n't really need the product .
I also will be better to see what you are buying , comparing the advertisement and the real look or weight , texture or taste .

"New advertisment is focused on appearance and not on quality

I believe that most advertisement is focused on create a cool image about a certain products .
Therefore , all these products are useless and will not satisfy consumers preferences .

First , companies are more interested to waste money on advertisement rather than on research and development ( R & D ) .
Consumers will prefer to have a more functional item rather than an item that is useless and expensive .
For example , few weeks ago I bought an Ipod and I was not sure to buy it because Mac has invested a huge amount of money and I heard some complaint about Ipod 's functionality .
Anyway , I bought an Ipod on Friday and just after two days from this day I accidentally drop it and my Ipod became useless .

Second , advertisement is always deep empty and it is aimed to show off a certain product .
Most of the people get surprised by a nice looking item and its advertisement , but I do not .
I take into account as a consumer the focus group that a certain item is aimed to .
And if I do not feel close to the idea of the advertisement , I will not consider to buy it .

Third , advertisement is aimed to hide qualities characteristics in order to cheat consumers .
I believe that a good quality product does not need any advertisement .
As an example , my oldest brother has bought a Bang & Olufsen Stereo and I have not heard of that brand of stereos before .
I did some research by internet about this brand and I got surprised because it is known that Bang & Olufsen is the best world wide brand for stereos .
Once again , advertisement always told me that Sony was the best brand world wide , but it is not if a consumer is looking for quality .

In conclusion , advertisement maybe guarantees a cooler product by its general consent , but not an effective one .
Advertisement is for not intelligent people and it always try to hide deficiencies on products .

"Most advertisements make a product seem much better that they really are .
And there is a reson why companies do that .
That reason is that with more buyers a product has , the more proffits they are going to make .
Producers are always looking for ways to attract more users of the product , and they do so by attracting people with adds that often might not reflect the truth about a product .

Firstable , in most of the commercials it appears that the person using the product is happier and is leaving an easier life than the one who does not use it .
For example ; in an add used by Toyota , the person driving the toyota could have a more pleasant trip and get to places faster .
And they show people in the street jeoulus and their cars seemed to be less effective .

Then we have the ads where only joung and beautiful people appear .
Beer add can be a perfect example of these ; because they are often shown whith girls in a bikinis and guys at a party .
This can measlead a persons thinking , and make them believe that drinking that kind of beer is going to make them feel goos and look `` cool '' in front of other people .
We know beer does n't make you more beautiful and cool it just makes you drunk ! .

Finally , adds never show the negatives effect of using a product .
In a cocacola add you are never going to see people getting fat or people showing a lot of cellulite on their boddies .
And there are the true long-term effect of drinking sodas .
You just see families and joung people having fun and saying taht cocacola is the best drink ever .

In conclusion , we don 's have to believe everything we see .
And to prevent being fooled by some attractive add , we must keep in mind that most companies are not tryinh to give us a better life , the are just trying to increase their proffits by making ud believe the product is right for us .
We need to be informed and make our desicions based on our other options and what is more convinient , not based on what an add says .

"It is often said that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Is it really so or has this statement no sense at all ?
Whenever an advertisement is conceived , an important issue , a part from the commercial target being aimed at , is the impact given or the message to be transmitted .
This naturally derives in a series of techniques adopted to produce the propaganda .
Many of these techniques might seem to make products look better than they actually are and therefore spark outrage .
Other do not instead , no doubt about that .
So the question is , are most advertisements like that ?

The answer relies on two issues .
One regards logical interpretation of the statement , the other , simple observation of propaganda itself .
As a matter of fact , the meaning of the word ` most ' should be specified beforehand .
But let us not pay attention to this cynical point .
As for observation , it is obvious that the type of product being advertised has an enourmous specific weight in the discussion .
For instance , certain products such as medicines cannot be made to look like better than what they actually are , whereas magical fat-loss meals tend to be over-advertised and are likely not to work .

Of course , generally , advertisements tend to outline the positive aspects of a product .
But this is justified by the nature itself of pubblicity .
So , in a way , the phrase could be always considered as correct .

On the other hand , as what is being put into discussion is not the nature of advertisement itslef , it would be fair enough to acknowledge the way propaganda is meant to be and proceed to reason not on the essence , but on the form of the problem .

In conclusion , the statment might be accurate or less accurate depending on the type of product considered , let still the nature of propaganda .

"The idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are has growned to be old-fashioned and too simplistic .
In my opinion , perhaps in the early days of advertisement the public was more naive and advertisers themselves considered that the effect of advertisement was much more powerful that it really is .

Today , I believe that advertisers have come to realize that it is much more effective to convey emotions and concepts related to the product than to state its wonderful and nearly miraculous properties .
Why ?
For two reasons .
First of all , the public is n't as naive as some people might consider .
They might be tempted to try a product that seems better than it really is , yet come to find that it is not as good .
This can be harmful for the product 's sales in two ways : the consumer will not buy it again , and he/she will feel cheated , misguided and angry .
Therefore , the image of the product will be damaged .

As a second reason for why I believe that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are is that advertisers know that it is better to work upon the real-deal .
That is , tell the consumers that what they see is what they will get .
However , advertisers do try to make consumers think that what they will get is what they need .
I believe that other than displaying the properties of products on television or radio , advertisements work more and more on consumer 's needs and motivations .
They wo n't lie , they know that their consumers are n't fools , but they will try to convince you that a particular product is the one that best adapts to your needs .
It is a sutile yet powerful difference .

"This essay will examine the question of whether or not most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
It seems pretty obvious that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The first example that comes to mind are the pictures of food at fast food restaurants .
One sees a perfectly looking hamburger in the picture , with fresh lettuce and tomatos and a enormous piece of meat , but when you actually get the hamburger you find yourself dissapointed looking at a squashed hamburguer bread with barely anything in it .
We could add many more amusing examples .
For instance consider all the weight-loss products .
The advertisement shows a before and an after picture of the person using the product .
The before picture is of a heavy ugly looking man , and the after picture is of a handsome fit man ( usually it is not even the same person ) .
In fact the person who actually buys the weight-loss product will soon discover that the miracle solution to his weight problem is nothing but a sham .

The simple truth is that companies have to lie a little in order to get attention for their products .
It is a whole different question whether or not these exagerations or glorifications or even straight - out lies will actually help sell the product .
It seems clear that consumers will stop buying a certain product that is made to look good in an advertisement if in reality it does n't work or is much worse than it appeared to be .
So producers have to realize that overdoing it on the exageration will end up backfiring on them .
Companies must add a little truth into their advertisements in order to make their products more appealing to consumers , even if that means reducing the charm of their product .
After all , the consumer will make the company suffer if the product it attempts to sell is garbage compared to the advertisement .

"I agree with the statement that most adevertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
As a matter of fact , I believe that this is precisely the whole purpose of advertising : convincing potential consumers of the good qualities or advantages of a specific product or item .
It is the ultimate goal that the consumer , buyer , or customer does what is being recommended in the ad .

Unfortunately , people in advertisement business may use all sort of techniques to sound convincing and be effective , which goes from mentioning only good qualities - and exclude those which are not so good - to emphasizing the bad qualities of alternative products or services .
For example , any shampoo advertisement will claim that it will make hair get shinier , glossier , and easy to handle in , probably `` no time '' .
Is it true ?
If we carried out a research to classify hair products ( just to choose any product ) into those which are effective and those which are not , we would probably end up with a ration of 1 to 9 .
For one effective shampoo , there are 9 which `` claim '' to be but they are not .

As consumers , advertisements have made us less gullible and more alert , as well as more careful when we make decisions on the basis of impressions created by advertisements .
By making a comparison , advertisements are similar to the reflection on a rear-view mirror , reason why a sticker reads `` objects in rear view mirror are closer than they appear '' .
We need to widen the use of this statement to many other contexts .

I personally think that , although there are regulations to control the advertising business in terms of using true/untrue statements and claiming results that they do n't actually deliver and sometimes even cause others , there is a strong need for further more-detailed regulations regarding the use of misleading techniques which make consumers make wrong decisions .
Consumers should be better protected because most advertisements use questionable technoques which manipulate the truth and that is dishonesty .

As a Tourism Manager I know perfectly this situation by studing the case of Touristic Destinations ' plans of marketing .
In one hand , they usually offer an exotic and pristine place that invites you to go there and make use of this facilities : well-equipped resorts , horseback riding for lonely beaches and hiking in magical mountains , on the other hand , these plans omits crowdy beaches during high seasons , hotel rooms that do not have ocean views and so on .
We could mention thousands of examples of this situation .
For me this should be ruled more rigidly and lead to protect in a better way to consumers who are cheated for this advertisers .

In this virtual world where information goes faster and faster by internet , the idea of advertising is becoming sample , cheap and less ruled .
It is easy to see web sites showing marvelous hotels and resorts pictures and with just one click make a reservation that costs hundreds of dollars .
When we get there the reality is so far away we realize that the hotel is not in the location shown or at least does not have the features presented , we understand the picture did not show how many ads and signal everywhere it was possible to see , making our enjoyable destination as polluted as a capital city and making our frustation the most unforgettable of our vacations .
This is a typical case of making products seem much better than they really are .
As an example let 's take Ocean City Maryland in The United States , whoever going to the different websites offering this touristic destination can see the Atlantic Ocean as the perfect background for a nice trip , we make a reservation and finally get there , nobody told us about the vehicular congestion , visual pollution and the noise made for teenagers running their cars overspeed .

This sentence is the premise that makes marketing one of the most profitable industries on our days .
As we live in a world in which the media controls millions and millions of minds , the more you are advertised the more you can influence the conduct of the market .

In the early 1990's , parallel to the boom of mass media , the introduction of the internet and the satellite TV companies around the world started to spend constantly more and more money on marketing .
Examples of how people 's mind can be controlled can be shown in almost all areas of production , from medicine to food industry , from clothing to transportation .

I am a medical doctor involved in the cosmetic industry .
Years ago , surgical procedures such as liposuction or breast augmentation were only reserved to a very limited section of the population .
This procedures involve several risks such as general anesthesia , prolongued recovery times , allergic reactions and even stroke or death .
As these procedures started to being advertise in TV shows broadcasted all around the world , such as Dr. 90210 or Extreme Make Over , the number of patients demanding these type of procedures rised globally in a geometrical or even exponential way .
Paradoxically , the risk factors continue to be the same , but as the procedures are more and more advertised , people often belive that the risks have been diminished .

Same situation happens with food .
Aspartame is the chemical component of Nutrasweet , an artificial sweetener that has modified the whole food industry .
Several medical studies were conducted years ago evaluating the safety of the high consumption of Aspartame ; the results were shocking .
Rats exposed to this chemical compound suffered from Alzheimer disease and several types of tumors ; however , marketing is so powerful that it could overcome the negative campaign .

Other examples can be offered and added to the list , but certainly they follow the same pattern .
Our mind is driven by certain impulses that we ca n't control , and the more times we get stimulated by something the more we get involved .

"Advertisements are a huge impact in today 's society .
They impact greatly on the decisions people make when choosing one thing over the other .
they can make one person change their mind about a thought they were holding very strong or make that thought even more stronger .
I agreee with the fact that advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are .

When looking at an advertisement people look on how this add makes a product look , the color , the person on it , the letters , many things influence a persons perception on the product by just looking at the advertisement .
If an advertisement is very colorful it might make a person thing oh this product is fun or it seems like very easy to use .
If in contraty it is very simple , the person may look at the product as boring or very lame .
also whoever is on the add can affect this , if we see a celebrity we might wanna use this product just so that we look as pretty as they do The problem with very well designed advertisement is that the prodcut may not be as well designed .
Many pepople when they see an advertisement that calls their attention alot , tend to assume that the products works just as well as the add was put together , and in many cases this is not true .

In my opinion I think advertisements make look product so much better that they really are .
In my own experience I have encountered this problem .
Once before i wanted to change my brand of sahmpoo and as i was looking at a TV add and I saw a particular kind of shampoo that callled my attention a lot because in the add there was a calebrity displaying how her hair looked after using this shampoo .
It callled my attention so much I thought my hair was going to look like that if I bought it .
I bought the shampoo and I came to find out my hair became very oily on the roots and very dried at then ends , nothing like what it looked like on that particular celebrity .
I was really dissapointed .

I think that when purchasing a product that we want to be of great quality , adds should be the last part we focus on .
We as potential buyers for any industry should focus more on personal experiences people have had with this product or just by doing some research .
Adds do not show the true quiality of a product all it does is make it more falshy so that people spend their money on it .

"In our days , we can find many product to buy .
Some of those products are very usefull , or make life easier ( like tools , clothes , and so on ) , but other products are not so important .
Besides , now there are many companies that are making the same product , so they need to compete in how they can win the preference of the people .
That 's why advertisements needs to show the qualities of a product , to make feel the buyer that one specific product is the best one that he or she can find .
But most of the time , they show the product much better that it is .

One example of these is a cleaner product .
A company creates a new detergent that , with the power of special `` air-beads '' , can make your clothe to seen whiter .
They are going to charge you more money because of these new air-bead , but the true is that the old detergent that is been in the market for so long is doing the same thing , only that they not invented the fancy name of `` air beads '' .
So , the power of advertisement can make you buy this new product , because you think is better , but in the end is doing the same think that your old detergent did .

Another example coud be a sports drink .
In a tv commercial they show that the person who drinks it fells so much better , with more energy ; now , he can run faster without felling tired .
But these new drink is only rehydrateting the body , and is not giving you more energy .

The life today is very different than the life that our grandparenths had .
The materialism is everywhere and that means that now you can buy many different prducts .
So the companies have to show that their products are the best , and the way to do it is with advertisements .
Maybe the difference between a X-sport drink and the Y one is not so important , But a colorful or melodic commercial can makes the difference in the moment the buyer decides wich product to buy .

"The Art of Advertising

Advertising is one of the most influencial techniques in people minds , human has invent a weapon to control the market .
Many major industries expend millions of dollars in advertisment , because advertisment is what really pop up their sales .
Products may be good , but advertisers try to make them look better .

Most of advertisments only shows the qualities of products , but deffinetly they dont show the bad face of them .

We are totally surrounded by advertisements , there are everywhere .
The cities are full of them .
Almoust all products in market are advertise in differnt places .
Our minds are fully influenced by them .

In my point of view , I agree with the statement , most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are .
To support this idea a perfect example is credit card comercials : If we see a credit card comercial on TV , tit might show us an incredible vacation in the Himalayas or a beautifull yatch in the middle of the caribbean , so the first we imagine is us on that situation , then the next think we do is apply for a credit card , deffinetly we will be the next person in the Himalayas or the caribbean , and that 's not true The true is that we might have the credit card , but we cant affort the trip , we need to work harder to get the money to pay the trip , if we dont have the money to pay , we wont be able to go , and the credit card wont be as usefull as it looks .

Another example might be the food advertising , non of the foods you get , are as good as big or as tasty as the ones they show on the advertisments .

Also must advertisers are proffesionals , and they know how to manipulate producs and make the look the way people want them to look , but when people buy the products , they are totally different from what they saw in the advertisement expect .

For me , advertisement industry is valid , people can make efforts triying to show the best characteristics of a product , but what is not valid for me , is that advertisers manipulate them to show advantages that the dont have .

"During the past decades , the introduction of a new marketing idea to increase the sells of a specific product were seeing in many parts of the world , this idea were the `` Advertisements '' .

As the question states , I stronly support the idea that products seems much better in their advertisments than they are truly are once you bought the product .
This can be easily found in all the health or beauty products that you can found in every corner of the entire planet .
By having an advertisment on T.V. it shows to the public not only the introduction of a new product but it also shows the `` advantages '' of using that product with the minimum aspect of having the desire result in a long period of time and | or using more than one time .
This is most likely the effect they have on a population .
Another important aspect that support the idea of looking a product which seems much better than it usually is , is by hiring well-known personalities in different areas of the entertainment market , examples of this can be identified by using a 24 year model using a product that will reduce the number of scars in her backside , or using a football player drinking a new product that will increase his perfomance during a sport activity .

Although it is important to notice these aspects , there is also important to focus on the new recently developed ideas that companies are trying to use these days and it is proving quite succesufull , this is the use of common people that resemble or is trying to be identified the real needs of the people , one example is having fast-food products that you can eat and enjoy while you are eating if you do not have time for have a proper breakfast or your time is reduced because of your work .
However , every product we see had a marketing process before the product was totaly aproved and was showed to the `` future '' buyers by imposing a much better idea that displays in an advertisments than they are really are , but it is also important to have a balance and try to satisfy the some needs of the buyer , because by not fullfulling this aspect , the company will more likely starts to loose customers , so they have to keep that in mind by not showing a product that will `` possible '' deliver to the customers a fill some of their needs in order to prevail the product as well the reputation of the company .

"I agree with the statment , advertisments make the products seem way much better thay they really are , acctually many times one feals cheated , as you realice the real characteristics of a product you just bought .

I think there are three main kinds of false statements that are usssualy done about products .

They make you think you need them , as far as i know we do n't acctually need all the things thay they promote , this is easy to observe on tv comercials , ussually it tourns out than they have just invented something that makes a work that you never do , realy easy to do , well great but I never do that any way .

The second common statment is , that their porduct is able to do some incredible things , needless to say that most of the times they do n't do anything outstandinglly differnt from what their lest expensive subtitutes do , I have a perffect exaple for this one , ther was a tv sales show , like ten years ago , that claim they have developed glasses that can help you see as an eagle , I mean it is good enough to be able to see as a normal human , and by the way that is a stament that we will never be able to prove ether right or wrong , therefore many people found themselves disapointed by their new sunglasses , because at least they did n't do what they expected , i am not saying that anyone liked them anyway .

An other typical disguise is to make you belive that you might acctually become a better person , in many sences , by consuming their product .
lets say they are tring to sell you a car , they display a picture of a young , athletic , good looking guy , sorrounded by a group of beautifull women , i can assure you that buying the car will not make you look like him or make you sudently irresitable for women .
Or how about the mp3 players advertisments > they make young guys think thay they will fit better on their social group if they own one .

Finally I have to recognize anyway that there are some exeptions , but not many .

"The statment shown uses a perspective which shows that most products display the beasr features an item should have , so when the items displays a lesser capacity , the client that purchesed the item has complaints about it and complains with both the company he bought it from along with the advertizement which influenced the purchess .

This is not the way it should be , since the only objective of an advertisement has is to make the connection between the client and the seller .
What happens in an advertisement process is : A seller comes to the advertisement agency and hires the agensy to communicate a new product on the market .
the Agency then takes a look at the product and makes an analisis on which demografic is most sutible to benefit fron this pruduct , the agency then makes an advertisment campaign that best suits the product and releasesit to the apropiate media .
This is what people see when discussing advertizement and categorize it as a form of manipulation , but bare in mind , no advertizment forces a customet to purches a product .
No one forces a customer out of ther homes and thretens to kill their children if they dont buy the pruduct .
They just display the item and tel people what it dose in a way the client might understand .

If an item does not live up to the expectation the client had of it , its simply because the client expected too much out of the item .
The ad agency is not responsible for a clients expectations .
theyr only obligation is to simply take the information the sellers give them and use that information to represent the product .

To sumarize this , Ad Agencies only reflect the informat a seller provides about an product , and the client is the one responsible of deciding if the product suts their need .
Defects and other such problems should go directly to either the theller or manufactorer of said product .

"To me , the whole point of advertising is to sell , thus when advertising you should try to seduce the costumer .
In fact there are many things or features of the product that you can use to do so , as the quality or the price , but always the main thing of show the good features over the bad ones .

I agree with the idea that advertisements make products look better than they really are , but I do n't see anything bad with it .
Indeed , our freadom of speech ensures us mainly the right to say almost everything to everybody , with some exeptions of course , but under this perspective anyone could told us anything , in particular how good is the product they are offering .

Most of the times , the advertisements do not lie or say anything strictly false , instead they focus on their strenghts .
Therefore is true that the products looks better than they really are , but is not ill will on that .
Indeed , it is the same thing you do when you go to a job interview , or try to approach some of the opposite sex for first time .
Think about it , in these ocations you try to look good , seem confident , very capable , intelligent or even sexy , realice that you are trying to look better than you are .

Although I consider that some exagerations should be avoided , becaouse they are not showing how good the product realy is , instead thay are a lie .
For intance , see the all magical recipies , belts and all kind of crafts and offered to lose weight , everybody knows that is a lie .
I think ths kind of things should be controlled by some costumer 's agency , which should request some kind of survey or stadistics to support things that are stated on the advertising .

Anyway , is in the costumer and the costumer 's agencies who will at the end decide which product deserved an which does not , our trust .
This is the only way of realy punnish tose that make reallly exagerated advertiments saying lies or said unproven things about their products .
But always whitout attaking the fredom of speach or see things in a particular prespective .

"I agree that `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' because their main purpose is to sell people their product of service , and they would do whatever it takes to increase their profits .

A typical example of this marketing strategy would be the advertisements used in the food industry .
Some cans , boxes or bags show their products really big , juicy and seeming tasty .
However , when the costumer opens the product , he sees that the product is much smaller and most of the time is not even similar to the product they were showing in the package .

Some fast food restaurants also show tasty pictures of their products , usually hamburguers , hot dogs , or sandwiches .
These meals seem to be much bigger than they really are , with fresh vegetables and soft bread .
But when the costumer actuallly recieves the meal , it turns out to be a small common burger .

No only the food industry uses those tricks .
A major industry that not only highlights the product itself , but the benefits it offers to the final user , is the beauty industry .
This industry includes make ups , magic pills , gel or creams and all sort of products that promess to make someone beautiful , skinnier of younger .
When trying to sell their newest product .
It is typical to see the `` before and after '' ads , showing a fat lady and then after taking the pills , or applying the gel or cream , she looks much better , skinny and healthy .

A variety of examples could be provided of how marketing people maximize the products ' capacities .
But the thing is that they actually do it and it is not properly regulated .
This is not only unethical for the costumer who buys the product , but for the potential costumer who is thinking about purchasing it .

In my opinion , the solution for this problem is legal regulation .
I think that all products ' ads that show better products than they actually are , should be taken away from the stores .
Besides , if any client complains about a product that did not met his or her expecations based on the product advertisement , should get their money back .

If a proper solution is not implemented , more people will be affected and finally , the company will loose actual and potential costumers , since no one wants to be mocked again .
And a costumer that is lost , is lost forever .

"What 's the goal of advertising ?
Selling , is n't it ?
Every punch-line , every jingle , every smiling girl or playful baby is used to sell us a product as a mean for obtaining satisfaction and , eventually , happiness .
Of course advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
But is it enhancing its qualities they only thing they do ?
Or do they work our minds in a much more complex and wicked way ?
We should n't ask ourselves if advertisments are the result of lies , because the answer is quite evident .
We should ask ourselves how they affect us and how to deal with them .

What publicity tries to do is not making us believe that their product is the best in the market , we can verify their promises by going to a local store .
What they really try to do is to sell us values and life-styles along with the product .
Venezuelan beer comercials are the best example I can think of .
Their target is young people , so they take activities young people tipically do , like going to to beach or partying .
Then , they create a clever and delicate web of images , phrases and situations that work our minds into believing that consuming that beer will make us cooler , funnier and more outgoing .
Drinking beer makes us into everything we 've always dreamed .
The sexy lady who drives boys crazy , or the stud that hooks up with ten girls on a single night .
Beer equals fun , like in a mathematical equation .

Of course , this process does n't occur at a conscient level , it 's way more subtle .
At the beginning we may not feel particularly atracted by the product , but after some parties where the situations showed in the ads repeat themselves contantly - Marketing geniuses make sure that they do - we are unwillingly drawn to it .
We start drinking , we feel confident and then we become consumers .
Advertisements have achived their goal .

The beer story is only a small fragment of the world of comercialization in the modern world .
There are ways of persuading people to consume that we ca n't even imagine .
So , what should we do ?
Should we leave the cities and assume an amish way of living ?
Should we deny civilization and return to a Roussaunian state of nature ?
I do n't think the answer must be that radical .
It all lies in our capacity of being critical , of seeing the thin threads intended to manipulate us and deciding whether to accept them or not .
Luckily , we are provided of freedom and capacity of choice , therefore we 're not determined by the influence of publicity , no matter how hard marketing geniuses try .
We must ask ourselves if we want to be comercial puppets or if we want to decide our visions of life and our social behaviour .
Both choices have their advantages and disadvantages , its up to us to decide who we want to be : The stud in the club or the outsider glaring full of contempt .

"I strongly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for several reasons .

First of all , the marketing has been always worked behind the objective of : `` sell ...
as much as you can the product '' , ...
and how do they know how to sell us something ?
how do they know how to make us buy what they want us to buy ?
Well , first of all , they study the consumers .

In my opinion , it 's more than obvious that everybody wants the best price based on quality everytime they are going to buy a product .
This is not something easy , because if a business create something with high quality and sell that product cheap , they would never get a good profit of it .
So , is you create a product , at a price , and you want to sell as much as possible , how are you going to do it ?
Well , there is where the marketing , and therefore , the advertisements , enter in our discussion .
It 's seems something easy , but it 's not .
The first thing they have to do is study the consumer , what they need , at what price , when and how much .
If the product that they are trying to sell , has everything the consumer wants , perfect , they did it !
but that is very very difficult , because no all the consumers are the same , it affects the age , the sex , where are they from , what they like ...
so , the solution is make the product and make it look like the consumer wants it to be .
It can sound strange , but I think that the objective of the advertisement is try to sell you something they want you to buy , sometimes a product that you really need for your life , but sometimes they create you wehat I called , artificial need .

Lets just try to think about us , I 'm sure there has been at least one time in the life of everybody that had bought something that it seemed great on television and then it is n't as good as we thought .

My experience was buying a car , it looked amazing on television and it has a great price too , but something cheaps costs you expensive ...
everybody was buying this car , so I decided to buy it and , at least , it was n't as amazing as I thought at first .

In conclusion , I strongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , because the objective of the advertisement is to sell you something and make you buy it , even if its as good as it seems , or not .

"In a highly competitive market , more and more companies are finding difficult to develop new ways of selling their products .
One of the most effective way has been advertising in all its layouts .
However , although the efficiency of advertising has been proved over the past of the years , it has also been a very controversial practise because it does not always present the products as they are in reality .
That is the reason that explain why thousands of customers complain about the products they buy every year .

I agree with this statement becasue I believe that the bulk of ads that surrounds us daily does not give us an accurately description and image of the product we are going to buy .
This phenomenon happens frecuently at Christmas .
During these days , a lot of parents buy gifts for their children and they follow what they see on advertisements either on tv or in the newspapers .
However , when children open their presents they are not only the ones that are dissapointed , because their parents are also surprised that the product is not as they thought in the beginning .

The point here is that advertisements present products in a very attractive way and they manipulate the image in order to make it appealing for potential customers .
However , what happens is that the final product is not as good as it was presented or even it has some negative aspects that were hidden in the ad .

Most companies outsource their advertising campaigns to others highly-specialized in advertising .
These ones produce a creative campaign of advertising that introduces a new product or new aspects of an old one in our society .
With this practice , companies are achieving to sell their products pretty easy and they are obtaining huge amounts of profits .

This advertising trend is just focused in the short-term consequences for a company .
However , in the long-term , when a company advertises its products in a different way of what they are in reality , it may be losing customers and potential customers in the future because they see that the company is not saying the truth about its products .
The last consequence of this practise is that a company will lose its position in the market and then all its profitability .

"I agree wit the presented statement .
The express purpose of advertisement is to induce a change in consumer behavior towards favoring the product presented .
Most advertisement arises from the need to create Product Differentiation - a process by which products that are in essence the same ( for example , two hamburgers , both are made of bread , meat , cheese , etc ... )
are presented to consumers as different ( Wendy 's , McDonald 's , Burger King , etc ... ) .

Product Differentiation is necessary in markets rueld by monopolistic competiton : several but not infinate suppliers , demand is not the only determinant of price .
In order to charge a higher price , a given supplier has to modify his product in the eyes of a customer : in comes advertisement .
Soda manufacturers have developed many brands ( Coke vs. Pepsi ) , small modifications on existing brands ( Coke with Cherry , etc ... )
and have to keep advertising to create the impression on customers that a branded product is different from , say , Walgreens-brand cola , and pharmaceutical companies have to convince customers that Advil is superior to generic ibuprophen .
By its very essence , product differentiation has to make a product appear better than the competition , desite the fact that they are the same .

Beyond product differentiatiob , advertisement is used to introduce new products .
New products have to overcome consumer 's initial guarding against the unknown using techniques such as celebritiy sponsors , or displaying other costumers satisfied with the product ( or wearing the product with a smile ) .
The implied message is , you will be like a celebrity or you will have the same smile or be as satisified as the portrayed individual .
This in essence makes the product seem better than it really is : there is no way a given product by itself can guarantee my satisfaction , as I have to provide a response , determined by my own notion of satisfaction .
Part of the purpose of advertisment is to modify this notion .

Advertisement is also prone to `` reporter bias '' , that is , only good or positive results and characteristics are advertised and negative or unfavorable results are of course hidden .
If the battery life is poor , no mention is made of battery life .
For well known health hazards , warnings have been introduced to the advertisement , which is an admission of the fact that the product is being portrayed as beneficial ( Marlboro can attract women , according to commercials , but of course can lead to cancer ) .

Now , a product can be advertised in a way that is more honest an up-front with the cusatomer .
Usually , this only happens when this is required by law ( for example , drugs ) .
However , the very nature of advertisement leads to down-playing the importance of these apparent flaws .
In all drugs commercials , mention of side effects comes well at the end of the commercial , are of course spoken over a powerful image of a satisfiedsenior playing with his grandchildren , and spoken quickly and in a soft tone of voice .
The underlying message : yes , drowsiness , but who cares when you can play with your grandkids ?

"Avertisement is a topic involved with marketing , and marketing is about creating long term relationship with customers .
Before focusing in advertisements , a company has to create a marketing plan of how to reach the target market .
If the marketing plan of a company is effective , the need for advertisement is not as big as the need of a company that has a bad marketing plan .
Why do I involve marketing with the purpose of advertisement ?
Well , because a problem is only solved when the roots of the problems are known .

When a company has a good marketing plan , that company will not have trouble reaching their target market and obtaining profits .
Starbucks is a great example .
This company developed an excellent marketing plan according to their values and their objectives .
Starbucks has reached all their objectives and without the need to use advertisement .
They do not need to tell the people how good their product is because the people already know it .
This example leads me to explain if I agree with the statement that `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''

I do agree with the statement because advertisements will be used only if the product or service needs it .
A commercial for example will make products and services look better than they really are because that product or service needs the consumer 's attention .
Of course I only agree with the statement because at the beginning of it , it says `` most '' .
If the statement would not have that word , I would not agree at all .
The reason I would disagree is because there are companies like MacDonalds that do not need the advertisements to sell their products , but they use them because the competition is huge , and they need their consumers to confirm why they are the best .

Advertisements are only use to catch the consumers attention , but it does not mean that the product or service will be exactly as is shown .
A person will only let himself believe everything he sees and hears if that person does not know why the advertisement exists in the first place .
Companies would do anything that is necessary in order to sell their product or service .
In a few words , most companies would do anything to be successful and make profits .

"Marketing has evolved throughtout time and has become more complex as time pases .
What used to be very simple , like introducing a new product to a market , has become a real challenge .
Now a days there are so much markets that are compiting between them , that the product that has the best marketing strategy is the one with the biggest revenues .

The best way to obtain attention from the clients , is showing them a product that covers all their needs , products that can do everything at the same time .
That is why most products seem much better than they really are , because there is no such product that can cover all , and even most , of the needs or wants of the posible buyer .

In television most products that are being advertised , really does not work .
That is why they tell you `` if you call within the next 2 minutes you will get a bonus pack '' , this way they get the attention of the person , by making them think they are getting not only the fabulous product , but also the amazing bonus pack , distracting them from the real product .

Another way of getting the attention of posible buyers is buy selling them lies .
Advertisements tell you all the things that the product can do , but really most of the time it just works partially , or not at all .

At the end , most people are really unsatisfied with the product they have bought , and end up buying the one which they really needed , and not the one that is giving you lots of promotions , that at the end does not satisfies the custumer .
It is really important to show what you are really selling , that way costumers will be satisfied with what they are buying , and they will continue to buy the best brand .

"Now a days , the media is flooded with advertisement .
From medicnes to sports , form food to cars , the media comunicates to the world new and sophisticated products every day .
However , many of these new products seem to be idealistic and fantastic to be true , thus questionning its reliabilty .
For example a medical drink for fat people that does not involve diets or doing sports .
I belive that modern advertisement is in fact the new type of propaganda , the media is flooding our minds with half truths and half lies at the same time .
The new machines for indoors sports are a typical example of this .
New machines that are suppose to work magnificiently over a small period of time , are not only expenseive , but also inneficient .

On the other hand , the poor reliability of adverstisement was imposed by ourselves .
The consumerism society we live in is constantly demanding for perfection , so that is why adverstisment tend to alter or bend the truth to some extend .
For example , if I see an advertisment about a restaurant , it is not enough for me to see the quality of the food they sell as their product , but it is more interesting if they tell me about the quality of their product , like how good their meat is , or how tastefull the bread is .
Therefore , this need of flare in comunication ways has created , for me , a different ideas of the products offered in a certain piece of adversitsement .

Although this may be true , occasionally some pieces of advertisement are really reflecting the true image of the product they are selling .
For example , machines and technology to make our daily lives easier , like new blender machines or washers , trully performe to the level the advertisemtent says it does .
However , for oneself , it may no be the case but the reason for this is that the machine is misused or its purpose misunderstood .

In conclusion , I believe advertisement sometimes exagerrates products , but also , sometimes it is us that cannot use them appropiately .
Therefore i belive that although advertisements do make products better , we must also be carefull on how we judge these advertisements an if we truly understand how the product works or to waht end .

"Throughout history , humans have competed and strived to find and derive the best way possible to advertise and sell a product .
This key concept is illustrated precisely by this statement ; for which , I would definately agree with the statement for three main reasons .
The core of this statement is rooted in essential marketing techinques that are vital for the sale and profit of any product .

The first main proof for this statement is seen in the essential concept that everyone that produces something to sell will want consumers to be attracted to the product by any means possible .
It is in human nature to allways want the best quality possible for what one is buying .
Thus , an advertisement that makes the product appear much better than they really are is a key technique in pulling a costumer to buy the product .
This is because the costumer expects the product the be at its best quality .
Once the consumer has decided to buy the product that attracts him ( due to the fine quality in the advertisement ) , he will go and buy it .

However , if a product creates a great demand due to is advertising it will cause an increase in the amount supplied , because more people will want it .
This brings the second proof for the statment .
In order to have a greater amount of the product produced , the company producing the item will have to forgo time and effectiveness in makeing a finer quality product , in order to make more , which are worst than what appear in the advertisement .

The third main point is that an attractive advertisement will draw people to buy that product over other similar competing products .
This will make businesses and companies make their product appear better than it really is in orther to get consumers to buy theirs over their competition 's .

Ultimately , as the world shifts into a greater consumer society , humans are going to want to see that their money spent ( investment in a product ) has a great appearnce .
There are many products in the market that even though they are not the best quality appear to be the best thorugh their popularity and heavy advertisments .
A real example could be seen with the recent popularity of the mp3 players iPod .
Even thorugh their technology , capacity , and applications is worse than others ( such as Sony 's Creative mp3 players ) , their attractive advertisement and global popularity have created a huge demand , even through they are not the best product for the amount of money spent on the market .
Therefore , through these three principles and the examples provided it is reasonalbe to see how most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

"Advertisements usually make products seem much better than they really are .
When a person walks down the street or is walking around in a mall , they are able to see all kind of flyers that exageratet the best characteristics of the products they are advertising making them look better than what they are .

From my personal experience I can say that this is true .
Once when I was around twelve a company called me to see if I wanted to do a comercial for a new cookie that was going to be sold in Panama .
Since I was a kid and they were going to pay me , I said that I would do it , no problem .
When I got to the place , they handed me a script , I was suppose to eat the cookie , and it didnt matter if it was good or bad but i had to pretend that I liked it anyway .
I went to work with other kids that were going to make that cookie look good .

When we started filming , instead of handing us regular cookies out of the box they were special cookies , these were taken appart and they had been added double fudge , so they lookked better , and they were made presentable by some guy who was fixing the vanilla fudge inside the cookie with a knive .
Instead of us using normal cookies from the package , they had to make special cookies that looked better than what they reallt tasted , because i can surely say that the cookies looked good but they didnt really taste that good .

Not only this happens with food but also with toys .
For example the hot wheel comercial for kids look great .
On TV you would think the cars are able to do flips and land back on track and keep going no problem , but once you buy that item , the thing falls appart .
The wheels of the car start falling , it jumps out of the track to never land on it againa , and to put the track together is almost as hard as trying to build a rubiks cube .

In conclusioin Items in advertisements always look better than what they really are , so people can sell them .
This is a selling technique , but you have to be careful , because you can exaggerate what an item does , but you can make it up .
Therefore , to be able to sell something , in the advertisement it has to look better than what it really is , and that is what people usually do , and based from my experience I think that is exactly what goes on .

"It seems possible to affirm that most advertisements make products look much better than they really are .
However , one must not forget that that is the `` nature of the beast . ''
After all , companies hire a multi-billion dollar machinery to convince us , avid consumers , of our need to look just like the perfect models from suburbia that are used not only to sell products , but also to use our vanity and lust to lure us to buy , buy , buy .

Let me give you an example of the way advertisment companies use our desire to look great and to be desired to make us buy their products .
Two days ago I went to the movie theater .
While I was waiting for my movie to begin , I was bombarded by a miriad of commercials advertising all sorts of products , all the way from beauty creams to cigarrettes .
After the third commercial with the sporty type advertising gym clothing , a membership to a trendy sports facility and the required pills to burn fat , I was feeling fat , grossly inadequate , and ready to run so that I could get all I needed to get on the right track .
All of a sudden , a deep realization struck me : all of that cannot be real !
I can exercise to the point of exhaustion , get all the right clothing , take all the prescribed pills -- not by a medical doctor , mind you -- and even then , I will never look like the blonde , blue-eyed , muscular guy on the screen .
Do n't believe me yet ?
Just ask yourself : how many curvacious women or Apollinean guys have greeted you at the car dealership last time you bought a new car ?

Some people would like to say that advertisements are nothing but a clear reflection of the products they offer .
While I am willing to concede that there is just little you can do to make a glass of milk look more apetizing than what it is , one has only to look at the `` Got Milk ? '' advertisements to get the point : to advertising companies , it does not matter if what they are offering is as good as they say it is , or even if the attention of the consumer is not so much on the product they are selling but on the personality they are using to advertise it , what matters to them is that it sells .

How many times have you been moved to get the trendiest , newest , more expensive brand of clothing , cellular phone , car , etc. just to discover after a brief period of usage that , in spite of all the empty promises and alluring techniques used by the advertising company , what you got is nothing but apiece of trash ?
Think about the famous Marlboro commercials .
How many people thought that smoking was a fancy activity just by looking at the romantic sunset with the cowboy looming on the horizon ?
How about the effects of smoking on your health ?
Care to talk about cancer and related illnesses ?
Obviously , truth-telling and advertising do not go hand-in-hand .

Most advertisement companies want one thing and only one : to sell their clients ' products .
If they need to lie , modify , or even disguise the real product or its effects in order to sell it , that is exactly what they will do .

"I agree that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
I support this statement for several reasons First of all there is the durability of the product in the market .
This means that if I can sell a product in a mass production way there is the need of lowering the cost of manufacturing in order to generate more money .
Which in turn means using bad quality products .
In return there is a significant investment in the marketing in order to be sold .
Another reason why products seem better in advertisment is because of technological advancements .
The use of several computer progrmas such as illustrator , photoshop and others have the possibilty of accenting in different ways the beauty of the product being advertised .
For example a macdonald commercial of a cheese burger , the size , the look of the ingredients everything is exagerated .
This also means being able to potray an unreal vision of what the product is .
Thirdly , competition , because the same product is sold by different parties the best visual statement made is the one that is going to sell the most , even though the product could be the same .

It is important to say that although this is a common marketing strategy people should be aware of this manipulation .
Specially by being well informed of the product being advertised in order to judge not only visually , the quality of the product .
A company decision to use advertisment exagertion to sell their product protrays a lack of respect towards the buyer .
And it is our responsability to regulate as buyers such manipulations

"When people think of making an advertisement for any kind of purpose , they always want to make consumers to get the right idea , or at least understand it .
For this purpose to function , the advertisement has to be perfect .
So , it may be true that adevertisements make products look better than they really are , although that does n't mean the product is bad .

The purpose for advertisement is to sell , or to change ways of thinking in peoples mind .
An easy example , is fast food restaurants .
They will never give a product as good as it appears in menu , but you will still buy it .
This means that since the moment you leave that restaurant , you will always now that the meal you had will not look like he one in the menu .
Still the restaurant will keep on adevertising their new meals or new promotions in the street or in their menu 's to create a confussion on the costumers mind , but make them think that the meal looks exactly as it is in the adevertisement .

If advertisements were not as perfect as they are today , they would not sell .
The point is to make people decide for something that they may no be convinced for .
So , if the advertisement shows the perfect way for people to get convinced for something , why not make them better than they really are .

This may create problems also , because you can loose clients everytime you give them something that is not what they expected , but as I said at the beginning the advetisement can be better than the real product , but it does n't mean that the prodcut is bad .
Maybe the client can no be as satisfied at the beginning but if the company tries its best apart of the advertisement to make the costumer think the product is good , this one will forget how the advertisement looked like .

In conlusion , the advertisement is a part of a strategy to sell products , but it is the first one to be seen by future custumers .
This means that its good to make them better than they really are , but there has to be a good job to satisfy the client in the moment of purchase and the moment of atending the cliente so the product will never be a bad product , although it seems better in the advertisement .

"I completely agree .
That is the purpose of an advertisement , to try to make things look better than they really are .
Our society is based in capitalism and consumism .
The more you make people buy things ( even the ones they do not need or work as they should ) , more money is made and companies are able to grow and expand .
If a company selling a specific product wants to be profitable and expand , it needs to let everyone know that its product is the best .

Now , if you are trying to sell a product but you just realized it has some flaws , would you tell the custommer about that ?
Most people would n't .
It would imply to invest more money trying to make the product better and capitalism is about making money not expending it .
After all , if a company can make money selling quality products they will do it .

In advertisements , marketing people look at the good points of a product and focus on them , making them look like the best option for the consummer .
Obviously , they wo n't say anything about its disadvantages or problems they will try to make people want to buy that product .

However , that 's why some countries have aggencies to keep track of custommer complainings made about bad products .
If they find there 's a problem with the product they might contact the company responsible for that and make it fix it or do something else in order to compensate the custommer expenses .

I think the important point here is the ethics of the company trying to sell products .
If the company only cares about making more money , they will try to sell low quality products , however if they have good ethics , they 'll try to sell always the best products even if they need to expend more money

if you show bad quality , you 'll be broke .
juan perez just opened a burger restaurant .
to promote his restaurant , he makes t.v. advertising , on which he shows he 's burgers .
the burgers are totally nutritive , but their their look makes people think they are disgusting .
evem though the burgers are very rich en vitamins and proteins , nobody buys them .
finally , juan goes to bankruptcy on his restaurant .
but do n't worry , this case happens in very few advertisings .

it 's all about the look .
companies such as mac donald 's , burger king and wendy 's , which sell the same type of products juan did , worry more on the way burgers look rather than the way they really are .
for example : it is proven that the big mac has an excessive amount of fat and it is very detrimental for men 's health , nevertheless , when someone watches the tv commercial on which the big mac appears , the first thing that comes to his orher mind is `` that burger looks good ! ''
.
the way the big mac is shown has a huge difference with the way it is in reality .
this strategy is done by almost every advertising company in every part of the market , not only food .

it is completely obvious that products are need to be shown in an `` almost perfect '' . almost every advertsing companies do this because of one single reason : if they do n't , they do not exist .
this means that they will suffer juan 's problem .
the principle of advertising is exposing the best part of the product .

"Nowadays people are talking about a broad range of controversial topics .
One of these topics is big amount of cars that are used in the world .
Some people belive that whithin twenty years the number of cars must be reduced a lot .
However there are just as many people who do n't agree and say that there will be a growing in the quantity of cars used in the world .
Both of the groups have several reasons to argument their opinion .

One the one hand those who believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than nowadays , say that the goverments of the differents countries must set restrictions in the use of cars to stop contamination problems caused by the combustion gases , such as acid rain or the growing of the hole in the ozone layer .
Also many people want to prevent cars coming into the city centre in order to make the cities more confortable to their citizens as well as to avoid traffic jams .

On the other hand there are people who strongly feel against the reduction in the number of cars that will be in use in the future .
Their main reason to say this is that the car is quicker than the public transports therefore it allows people to save time in their movings .
Furthermore the high prize of the tickets for the bus or the underground do n't help leaving the car at home .

To sum up the topic of the number of cars in use in the future will remain controversial .
While some people mantain that in twenty years the number of cars in use will be smaller , you can find just as many people who think that this number must even grow .
In my opinion , unless we discover any kind of non-contaminating car , we should restrict the use of vehicles to preserve our planet in good conditions .

"In today 's society , which is characterized by a hectic way of life , the desire of going everywhere employing fewer and fewer time has dominated the transportation market .
The result is that in recent years the number of cars used has increased spectacularly .
But , will this trend continue in the following years ?
This is a very controversial issue .
On one hand , the enviromental problems and future supply shortage are pushing governments to face the transportation problems in different ways .
On the other hand , there are a big and powerful industry which will make hard to abandon the systems based on fossil fuels .
In my opinion , the current situation is bad enough to compell society to offer alternative solutions to this problem which will result in the decrease of the number of cars .

To begin , the amount of fossil fuels available is decreasing very rapidly .
Therefore , some time in the future will be no oil or gas .
This is a cogent argument which should compell governments to take some measures to prevent that situation .
This opens up a bunch of alternative possibilities to provide another means of transportation different from cars .
The first solutions should focus in reducing the use of fossil fuels .
This include enhance the use of public transportation , foster the use of bycicles in cities and so on .

Further solutions will take into account the substitution of fossil fuel dependent cars .
The new technology develop to overcome this problem will result in new types of machines , which can be similar to cars , but will be no longer the traditional cars .

Another crucial point , is the enviromental issue .
During the last years more and more people are aware that the use of cars contribute highly to the pollution .
In fact , in some big cities , such as Mexico D.F. and Milan , strict measures had to be taken in order to reduce the air pollution .
Such measures include restriction in the acces to the center , in the days of the week one can take the car , etc .
In conclussion , all the possible solutions indicates that a reduction in the number of cars circulating need to take place .

Summing up , keeping in mind all the problems mentioned above , it is clear that the current trend regarding the use of car can not be held .
Enviromental , social and technology arguments indicate that new means of transportation will gradually take the place of today 's cars .
Therefore , the number of cars in twenty years will be definitely less than the number of cars used today .

"I disagree , I do not think that in twenty years there will de fewer cars in use than there are today .
People who think differently probably feel protecting the enviroment merits strict regulation restricting car use .
Nonetheless , such regulations have proven , in many instances , to accomplish the contrary regulatory goal .
For example , in places such as Bogota , Colombia , longstanding restrictions on car use have helped to improve the traffic situation during rush hours .
Nevertheless , such restrictions have been ineffective as regards the overall number of cars in use .
The restriction implemented in Bogota , and other Colombian cities , allocates the right to use a vehicle during rush hour on certain days , depending on the last number of the license plate .
For example , license plates that end with the number `` 2 '' may be used on mondays , wednesdays , and fridays , an not on tuesdays and thursdays .
Such a meassure has greatly increased the demand for automobiles , since peolpe are not willing to use the preecarious transport system in place in the city , and prefer to buy a second car in order to avoid the restriction .

Considering the exponentiality of birth rates , and the importance of car manufacturers as job generators , I think it is safe to assume that more and more people will become car buyers , and automotive industry employees .
I also think that researching better fuel alternatives , and better , enviromental friendly materials and car construction techniques may lessen the impact the industry has on the enviroment .
In sum , I do not think the number of cars will decrease in twenty years time for four reasons .
First , Restrictive regulation is not always the best alternative , and sometimes even makes the situation worse .
Secondly , there is no reason to beleive that that overall demand will decrease , given the fact that population increases , and ecomonies such as China , which are waking up will surely fuel the market for more than 20 years .
Thirdly , the industry generates a lot of jobs , it is very important , and lastly new technologies may lesser

"I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
First of all , I think that the people today worry much more for the envioronment than in the past .
The goverment and associations such as Green Peace try to get people involved to protect our planet and in my opinion their are achieving their purpouse .
There are lots of people that go to work in bus and other public ways of transport , or share a car with other people to go to work every day .
The governments in some countries are also trying to control the pollution by laws and restrictions such as not allowing to drive cars one day or another depending on the number plate .

Another fact that I think will influence on the decrease of the number of cars in use is their price and the price of gas .
Young people that start their first job do n't earn enough to buy a car and to pay for gas every month .
I think the priority for them is to buy a house and since these are really expensive they do n't think about buying a car .

On top of this , going by car to a big city is a huge waste of time because there is always a lot of traffic .
For example , my friend Ana has to leave home at half past seven in the morning to go to work , but she does n't start until nine o'clock .
After the hard day of work she leaves at half past six in the afternoon , but she does n't get home until eight o'clock .
She wastes three hours every day on the road !
That is a lot of time and I think people are realising that is better to get the train because you know that you are always going to be on time and not wasting your day on the road .

However , nowdays are a lot of cars everywhere and , in general , we use the car for go everywhere .
Consequently , it 's difficult to imagine a city with fewer cars .

I really think that in a short period of time it will be less cars everywhere .
There are a lot of reasons for think like that .
The first one , is that in some years will be very expensive use the car .
For example , the petroleum resources are finishing and everyday the gas price is increasing .
Another example is that in Barcelona in most of the places we have to pay to park the car .
This reasons make public transport cheaper in comparation with car 's price .

The second reason is that in the big cities is faster go by public transport everywhere than go by car .
We have a very functional and complete underway , with a lot of lines .
It is also very regular , we have one every five or ten minutes .
Moreover , there are a lot of underway stations in the city .
If you use this stations you do n't have to spend time looking for a place to park the car .

On the other hand , the people who live outside the city has a lot of problems for use public transport .
In most of the little cities or towns , the public transport only works one time in an hour or maybe the station is at 30 minutes walking .
If this happens , it 's easier and faster go by car than use a public transport .

In summary , I think that the number of cars will decrease in the big cities , with good public transport , and it will be the same in the litlle cities and towns .
Unless the goverment improve the public transport overthere .
In conclusion I think that it will be fewer cars in the future but it will not happen everywhere .

We all know that the world population is gradually growing to its extreme .
Of course , and unfortunatelly , this means a consequential growth of many things , such as cities , houses , polution and waste .
That in twenty years fewer cars would be running through our highways seems trully hard to believe .

Even if I would like the first thing to happen , I am not very optimistic about it , and I will now explain the main points that support my answer .

First of all , I am afraid that if we take into account the entire world and not only the developed countries , we can see that in many regions having a car is still a luxury that not everybody can afford .
But as these places get more and more advanced , cars will be introduced as they were in Europe and America a long time ago .
As an example , when I was traveling throgh South America last year , I came across something that surorised me .
Even in remote spots along the Amazon river , people managed to get cars or motorcycles , and this not only was a sign of their wealth , but also a means of living .
But the main idea here is that only five years before that , there was not a single car in that area , and they said that each month the number of cars was increasing really quickly .

On the other hand , we could think that in twenty years there will not be enough petrol reserves in the world to keep up with the fast growing in the number of cars .
Nevertheless , I am sure that alternative ways of power will be developed as soon as the act of obtaining and trading with petrol is no longer profitable enough .

In a word , although I dream with a world with less pollution and traffic jams , I cannot deny the fact that , as it was said in a very famous movie or play , `` money makes the world go round '' .
Therefore , I am afraid that while having a vehicle helps a person to have a better life , no-one will exchange that for a better place to live in .

"Historically the growth on the numbers of cars has been keept increasing constantly since the third decade of the previous century .
There are no signs of any reversal on this patern , and moreover recent research shows that the situation could be worst on the next years .

First , as the world develops , more families are able to get a car , nowdays the cars are not only for rich and welth people , reduction on the final costs , for average cars ( luxury cars are keep apart of this analysis ) , and the improvement on the world average salary , probably helps to narrow the original economical divide .

Countries under develpment , are a huge potential market for new cars , as the economies of this contries get develop , the life quality of the population grows , also their expectations and their posibilities to get new cars .

Other people migth say , that fuel costs , pollution regulations , and the limited parking space on big cities could stop the sales , and begin with a reduction on the total number of available cars .
Against this people I could only ilustrate that the costs on fuel are comparatively lower today if we compare the fuel with many other products .
The regulations to decrease pollutions are adopted by each individual countries , and also the new cars are complaint about most of this regulations .
The other aspect about parking spaces , could be mitigated with the reduction of car sizes or the develop of new parking technologies .

Personally , I do belive that in twenty years this number of used cars will be much more that there are today , maybe is not the best for us , maybe it is .

In my opinion , we will still use cars in twenty years time but no for so much longer and no as much as we use cars now .
The main reason why I think this way , is because obviously our natural resources are decreasing very quickly , especially , the petrol and everybody knows that this it is a limited resource .
Anyway if we still have some , in twenty years time , the price of petrol will be so expensive than just a few people will be able to afford it , and it would be reflected in the number of cars in use .

Another reason to support my idea is that hopefully , harder laws in relation to enviromental and ecological issues will be aplied , therefore people will be more concern about the danger we are exposing earth just using our cars everytime we want to go somehere .

But , probably , more than anything else , the reason cause I thing cars will no be in use as much as they are today , is that important changes in transportation , distribution of the cities and new energetic resources will come soon .
Maybe new discovers about the use of nuclear energy will help to develope new ways of tranportation or will increase the private use of the aeroplane .
If we think , that probably the cities will be situated far away from each other and in more isolated areas , with no roads , the use of the aeroplane as private transport will be very usefull .

Summarizing , if the volume of cars will remain the same , will reduce or increase , is a question that will be anwered in a very short while .
Meanwhile , I think we should start reducing the use of automobiles and bidding for alternatives ways of tranportation as the train , tube or tram which are more favourable to our enviroment .

"It is dificult to forecast the evolution of the use of cars in twenty years , because it depends on a lot of factors that could change in such a long time .
However , and given the news that we are facing all days , I think is possible having an accurate idea about what the future will be , and in this future will be fewer cars .

At first , looking back to the past , we can see that the development of car manufacturing was linked to some social and economic factors .
In the very beggining of car industry , a car was considered a luxurious device for most of the population , but thanks to Henry Ford , the private automobile became a popular consume good , formerly in the United States and later in Europe .
In its heyday in the fifties , the american cars were a symbol of power and wealth in all the countries of the world .

Nevertheless , the environmental conditions have changed widely in the last decades .
The continuous rising of the gas prices , linked to the political unstability of the leading productors ; the rising of the consciousness that the planet resources are limited , and the fact that the natural environment is being harmed , have changed the attitude towards the private car .
Indeed , the urban life has been severely disturbed by the wide use of cars .
The possibility of using the car to conmmute everyday has created the sprawl phenomenon , with the bitter consequence of decaying inner cities , collapsed highways , destruction of farmland , pollution , and lack of social contact in the car-oriented suburbs .

Therefore , I think that the use of the car will be reduced in the future .
It is necesary that all the society face the environmental and social problems that cars are creating .
Of course I think that cars are useful and I drive , however , I think that cars should be used in a more smart way than today .
Combinig the car with efficient public transportation networks , we will create a different and most sustainable pattern of urban growing .

"In every country we go , there is a large number of cars , but this figure will decrease in the future .
I think that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Nowadays there are so many cars in the world that we will be forced to abandon them in the future .
There are certain factors that I want to point out that will favour this decrease .

First of all , I think that it will be imposible for everyone to have a car .
The car prices but specially the petrol prices will go up steadily in the future : the fuel is going up and up everyday , but it will get worse as they become scarce .
Petrol prices are expensive now but they will be impossible to pay for a large number of people .

The pollution will be another factor that will decrease the number the cars in our streets .
We all have to be aware of the dangers of the pollution that cars produce .
The car smoke is one of the key factors of pollution in many countries .
In is important to bear in mind that we are damaging the planet and soon this damamge will become irreversible .

Also , in a more practical approach , traffic will act a deterrent for many car buyers in large cities .
In the future , it will be impossible to drive in the cities and more and more people will use the public transport .
Although there are many citizens using the public transport , it seems that figures will increase every year .

Regarding the public transport , citizens should put more pressure on government so they create an effective public transport network .
In my opinion , if this objective is accomplished , people would rely in the public transport and would abandon the need of the car .

In conclusion , I think that in twenty years there will be less cars in our streets than there are today .
I think that we will need to consider these points in order to use or not use our cars .

"I am deeply sorry to have to disagree with the statement , specially because my idea of a better world includes the reduction of private transportation in benefit of public transportation .
The truth is that I do n't see that happening anytime soon. : ( Let 's do the maths >

First of all , the degree of development that countries like China , India and others are achieving , will bring access to a huge portion of their citizens to private transportation .
Even if the rest of the world still would use the same number of cars that is currently using , that would make the difference .
So we can add some hundred of millions to the current number of cars ...

In the meanwhile , the population in developed countries keeps growing , what lead us to discard the idea of a possible reduction of vehicles on these developed countries .
So we keep adding some millions ..

The results of the research of alternative sources of energy , if possitive , will probably boost the car sales in the future .
Yes , we can still consider them '' cars '' even when they do n't run on gas anymore .
At that point , having a car will probably make more sense than ever .
The idea of making 500 miles for only 2 dollars sounds definitely very appealing .
Ttraffic jams could be the only reason to use public transportation by then .

Our cities will become more and more overpopulated and hard to move through , proving the use of public transportation as the most effective way to move around .
Yes , that probably will happen , but still we will probably like to have our own car in the garage to use it during the weekends .
We wo n't resign to that feeling of independece and of course the rest of member of our family wo n't do as well .
So my opinion is that the reduction in that respect wont be very significative .

All that said , My opinion is that the number of cars in 20 years will be higher than is now .

"It would be beautiful to believe that twenty years from now fewer cars would be circulating on our streets ; but the sad truth seems to be that , in that period of time , many more vehicles will fill our streets and contribute to polluting our world .

On one hand , it is true that technology is rapidly evolving and that what today is `` brand new '' , tomorrow will be completely obsolete .
The perfect example of this is computers .
PCs become obsolete almost as soon as they are finished .
The same thing applies to cars .
It could be that the great love that many have for cars today , died tomorrow due to a guilty conscience or environmental awareness .
People could start using other means of transportation that pollute less .
Or the automotive industry could create a new way of collective transport that would lead to less cars on the streets .

On the other hand , it is difficult , in a such globalized environment , to believe that the main mean of transportation : the car , will , in such little time as twenty years , be less used .
The fact of the matter is that cars are all around the world .
Everybody needs one to go everywhere .
Even young adults try to prove who they really are to others thanks to the car they own .
In New York , for example , not everybody owns a car , but taxis are available for those who need them which is , basically , the same thing .
How does someone from a small town go to work in a big city ?
By car , even when there are buses or trains available .
One could walk or go by bicycle to many places in his or her town : groccery store , post office , etc. , but many still prefer driving .

We have to face the truth .
I disagree completely with the statement because I do not believe that our world is moving in that direction .
We are still not aware of the great stress cars are causing on the environment and I do not think that we will be in twenty years .
It is not that I am not hopeful , I am , and I really hope that I am wrong in not believing in humans , it is just that I look out into our lives and I see what is there , not what I wish to see .

"At the beginning of the 21st century , the increasing number of cars in use worldwide is a key environmental issue .
It does not only affect the level of pollution in the air but it also amplifies the green house effect and it seriously endangers the sustainability of the earth 's energy ressources .
Although some important signs show a general willigness to reduce the number of cars in use , I believe the current trend is very difficult to change .

On the one hand , it is visible that there are clear forces trying to influence the increase in the number of cars .
The environmental consciousness of the public is more important than ever and could be a good driver for the reduction of the number of cars as citizens themselves decide to not use or use less frequently their cars to protect the environment .
There are also several policies put in place by givernments , mostly in Western countries , to try to reduce the usage of cars .
These policies include for instance , the development of public transports , the closure of some roads or city centers to cars or incentives given to drivers to share btheir cars to go to work .

However , I belive other factors will hamper the reduction of the number of cars in use .

In fact , one important reality once has to face is that the environment concern is more widespread in Western countries , which do not represent the majority of the earth populiation .
In parallel to the environmental movements that are growing in developped countries , there are many developping countries that are growing very fast .
And people in those countries seems to be very eager to achieve the same standards of living as we have in western countries , and this includes access to cars .

For all those resons , I do n't belive the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years although it is necessary to achieve a sustainable development of the planet .
",P5,SPA,high,0
"I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will fewer cars in use than there are today .

As cars become cheaper , safer and more user-friendly , more people will choose cars as their main means of transportation .

Some people may argue that technological advances in telecommunications may reduce the need for transportation .
I think that , while it is true that there has already been a general decrease in business trips , the use of cars for private transportation will continue to increase in the future .

Others may argue that more efficient public transportation will render cars obsolete .
However , I believe that although public transportation is a key factor in development , it will never substitute cars because of its inherent limitations .

The cost of producing a car has been greatly reduced in recent years whereas their convenience and performance continues to increase .
Nowadays fully equiped cars such as the Renault Logan or the Subaru Pleo cost around three thousand dollars to produce and are sold for aroudn five thousand .

Another important factor is the rapid growth of the automotive markets in developing countries such as India , China or Brazil .
In these countries still relatively few people own a car but there is a great potential for growth .
In China , for example , last year saw a twenty percent increase in units sold .
Following this trend , many car manufacturers are launching low cost BRIC ( which stands for Brazil , Russia , India , China ) product lines designed to meet these market 's demands .

In conclusion , although it is true that the use of cars may be reduced in specific situations , I believe that in general the number of cars will continue increasing .

"Evaluating on the topic question i agree with the statement .
I belive that the government and the people have started acting on this issue already .
Combustion is one of the main problems causing global warming the headlines which read that London will be under water in 60 years if we do not act soon , are terrifying people .
Hydrogen buses and cars are being built but still people are being convinced to take public transport .
As the years progress and global warming gets worse people will start to realise what is happening in the past people did not really act upon what was being said because they knew that it was not going to affect them , but it has come to a time were it will affect our generation wether we like it or not and as soon as people start realising that , then they will start doing something about it .
Big cars will be banned from major cities and families will be forced to own only one car .
The amount and size of cars today is ridiculous there is no more parking anywere and soon there will be no more petrol available to us .
Making it more expenisve to fill up your car so people will take more public transport .
Our world has changed enormously and people now have jobs away from home making the families own two or more cars .
Even though it is our world at stake .
London is working on banning land rover 's today as we speak they apparently take up to much space and parking , the process will carry on limiting people to only fundamental transport .
People are starting to realise what a mess of the world we have made , and the changes occuring around us such as the Maldives going under water or natural disasters such as the Tsunami are all effects of what we are doing to the planet and people are slowly realising what has got to be done .
Fewer cars will also hopefully make people use the most of what is around them such as holidays in their own countries and therefore will also lower the use of other big means of transport such as airplanes and boats which as well as cars are polluting the environment .

"Nowadays most of the people could n't do without their car .
There is no doubt that the grade of dependance upon the car varies considerably depending on the culture and the country we are focusing on .
For example , in the american way of life a car is simply essential , while the citicens of Amsterdam , for instance , make a greater use of bicicles than cars .
However , we desperatly depend on something that must have and end and whose end is unlikely very close : oil .

Therefore , everybody would agree in the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Perhaps twenty years is n't a long time but I 'm sure that we are at a turning point .
In my opinion there have already ben made incredible improvements that would have helped us to move towards ecological cars .
However , i 'm certain that at this point it has n't been interesting economically speaking puting them in the market .
More than once have we heard in the news that an engineer has finally discovered how to build a car that works with hidrogen or other organic materials .
However , just as happens with the powerful industry of medicaments , sometimes an improvement is ironically not benefitial .

I probably sound tremendously skeptical but I must say that I 'm hopeful that someday not in a long time somebody will make a car that does n't pollute and depends on a renovable good .
That would definately cause an increase in that car 's demand , what would mean a dicrease in the use of the traditional car .
Anyway , even if my best wishes do n't come true , I would still believe that in twenty years time a decrese in the use of the traditional car will occur in the developed countries .

To ilustrate my point I will take China as an example .
The population in China is huge and , while most of Europe and North America has already experiences a crazy developing period that has lead them to industrialisation and our actual welfare , China and many other asiatic countries are now at that point .
And , unlikely , we can not demand en ecological consciousness from them , when we ourselves have had non of it .

"Usually , long ago people do not use the car as people use it now .
Nowadays we can not live without using the car .
Lot of people use the car to work , to go shopping and so forth ...
There are several advantages and disadvanteges of using the car .
Day by day prices of the petrol are going up and there is a luck of this energy source .
Many governaments and investors are trying to develop alternative energies in order to improve the quality of cars using those energies and they are trying to promote the use of the public transport and other vehicles .

On the one hand , we have those who think that in twenty years there will be more cars than now , because it is the faster and the more individual way to travel .
They believe that there will be alternative sources in order to satisfy the luck of petrol , but they also argue that there will be a big demand of high technology cars .

On the other hand , we have those who believe that in twenty years there will be a great decrease of cars due to people will be concerned about the enviorement and the pollution .
Governaments will make the public transport cheaper and there will be many new users of this kind of transport .
Maybe there will be a discover of a way of transport cheaper and faster than cars and that can be used whenever and whenever one want .

On the whole , although both opinions can be argued strongly , I really believe that in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use than now .
In fact , I think that there may be more cars than now , because the world is growing so fast and most people preffer cars than any other way of transport .

"In twenty years the number of cars will be even larger than the number of cars that we have nowadays .
There are many reasons to think this , the most obvious one is that technology wont be able to create a substitute for the car in only twenty years .
There are other reasons that are more human , like dependency .
In twenty years cars will not be as bad for the enviroment as they are today but the number of cars will increase noticeably .

In the last century technology has changed our way of living , one of the most important inventions was the car .
Who can imagine what would happen if suddenly all the cars in the world disappear ?
it woul be a caos , the level of dependency that we have on cars is very high , we need them .
Cities are built in a way that life without a car is like hell , almost impossible .
Distances are longer and roads are made for them .
But the main reason is on technology , cars are now starting to use electricity as their source power ( even tough they use gas too ) but this improvement does n't help to the problem of the number of cars .
Because there will be cars that do not use gasoline but they will still be cars .
The United States is the model for the world and cities there are really wide , cars are really needed , american families have a minimun of two cars .
So as the world gets `` americanized '' more cars will be used .

We also have to note the human incapacity to find an alternative .
There are alternatives but none of them is perfect .
We can use buses or trains but in order to use a train or bus you have to go to the station and it will not leave you at the exact point where you want to go .
Some people can say that riding a bike is the solution , but let 's be real , are people going to ride a bike when they can go five times faster using a car ?
without getting tired !!!
Bikes are the ideal solution but our human condition makes us lazy and consequently the bicicle option disapears .
Maybe in the future the cars will fly , that would solve a lot of problems , but it is not something that will happen in the near future .

Cars present to society as an issue to be discussed .
In fact , cars have been discussed already and are changing as I am writing .
Different asian companies such as Honda , or Nissan have already developed a hybrid car .
This car is based on a mixture of electric power and fossil fuel or commonly known as gas .
This only represents a change along the car product and not just on the industry as a whole .
However , this represents the beginning of the cars death .

Technology has changed massively over time .
Type writters have been replaced by computers , in a matter of 30 years .
Computers would also be replaced in some sort of way in the future .
Cars would also be replaced by different methods of transportation that are more friendly to our globe .
The earth is everyones house and therefore it must be clean and taken care of .
Cars represent a threat for this and therefore they will dissapear .
It is only a matter of time .

People are starting to be more concerned about the enviroment .
Finally some common sense is shown by the population of the world when a newspaper showed that the ozone layer had increased its area over the last year .
This news would follow the partial abolishement of cars as a way of transportation .
Countries like Switzerland , using electric buses show concerns about it .
Cars however , would not be able to dissapear totally .
There would always be someone who would have a car .
However , the rate of cars per country would massively decrease during the next 20 years .
Again the companies stated above are already thinking about diversification and even massive producers of cars such as Ford or General Motors are making huge amounts of losses for this last quartiles .

It should therefore be concluded , that it is only a matter of time for cars to decrease in number .

"In twenty years there will be much more cars in use than there are today , if nothing unusual like a world war happens .
And the main reason to support this idea is just because the world 's population is growing very fast .

In particular , the population of developing countries is increasing at a rapid rate , and many of these countries are attaining very high rates of development .
Let us think about China : it has a population of more than one billion people .
China 's economic growth rate is 9 % .
Nowadays still many people in China is poor , but as long as the country continues to recover , more and more cars will be demanded .
The same phenomum is occuring in countries like Brasil or India .

The fact that the amount of oil to produce petrol is limited and will no longer exist as the main powering source used by cars and other means of transport , does not imply that the amount of existing cars will be reduced in twenty years .
First , after that period , there still will be petrol enough to be used by cars , and second , there will be other alternative sources of energy like hydrogen .

Like or not , cars are nowadays our principal mean of transport , even people do not use them in an efficient way .
Many people go to their job by car , and prefer it to the public transport .
But , for example , most of the times an average person uses a big car of four places for this purpouse .
This causes many traffic problems and pollution .
To solve this new public policies are necessary to reinforce and to enhance the use of public transport by making it cheaper .

In conclusion in twenty years will be definetively more cars than today but they should be re-invented .
They probably will be different : smaller ( just for one person or two ) , they will consume less energy and use alternative-clean energy sources ...

"I completely agree with the proposed statement .
In my opinion , there are sound reasons to believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .
First , I think that pollution has become a serious global problem that soon will have to be solved .
In addition , I believe that unaffordable oil prices will incentivate people to use other kind of transportation .

First of all , we may argue that nowadays almost everybody supports a dramatical reduction of pollution .
We all can agree that cars contribute to increase urban pollution .
In order to tackel this problem , some cities , such as London , have implemented new regulations that do not allow people to drive cars around the center of the city .
From what I see , much more cities should apply this sort of policies .
Likewise , many cities are currently improving the services rendered by their public transportation in order to provide people with a good alternative to the car .
I think that these two measures will incentivate people to avoid using the car ; thus , we may conclude that fewer cars will be in use .

Secondly , I consider that soaring oil prices will also help to have fewer cars in use .
From my point of view , oil has already started to be a really scarce good , and even now many people have problems to pay for it .
Hopefully , people will realize that using the car is not sustainable from both an ecological and an economic standpoint .

To sum it up , I do believe that in twenty years we will see fewer cars running through the streets .
We may expect that people will colaborate to reduce pollution and will start using public transportation .
In addition , I think that oil prices will prevent people from using the car or , at least , will incetivate people to use it less .

I do n't think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .
In fact , I do belive that the number of cars in use will increase dramatically .
One fact that may cause this is that there will be more single people than nowadays , and they will all need a way of transportation from home to their place of work .

Another reason why numer of cars will increase is that rich people love cars .
They think they are better persons if they have more cars than anyone .
That 's why they will keep on buying them and using all of them to try to show how rich , powerful and great persons they are .

In addition , cars are may be the best way to get from one place to another : it is the cheapest way to travel , and you are free to decide where you want to go , even to change your opinion during the travel .

But cars do represent a big problem to our environment .
They produce toxic gases that affects the ozone layer .
Due to these gases our lungs are polluted too .
Now there are more people with cancer than back then .

In the future , cars will face another problem : the matter that there will not be enough oil to all of them .

Is there anything that we can do to protect ourselves and our environment from pollution and also still have the chance to travel whenever we want , wherever we want , anytime we want ?
Yes , there ir .
But the solution , unfortunately , has not been developed yet .
We need new ways of transport , such as vehicles that runs thanks to electricity instead of oil .

"I think that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years because of several reasons .

First of all , there is a growing environmental awareness that is going to drive the decrease in car usage .
People are increasingly aware that current pollution levels and even oil resources are not sustainable in the long term .
Even nowadays there are examples of city majors banning the entrance of cars to certain areas in order to protect them , and this could well be a growing trend looking forward .
An efficient technological alternative to oil has to be found but until this outbreak occurs , governments would have to find a solution to make the best possible use of the limited oil resources .
Therefore , a possible solution would be to encourage the use of public transportation while disencouraging the use of cars ( taxes , fees to enter certain city areas , increasing parking fees , etc . )

In addition to environmental awareness , I think that people would actually end up finding public transportation a better way to move around than cars .
This would obviously need a general improvement of public transportation , but it seems quite reasonable that this improvement will occur with the government aligned in a drive to restrict car usage .
Once public transportation is improved , people will without any doubt choose it because of two resons .
Firstly , people like to travel in the fastest and safest way .
Public transportation will be a safer way of moving around than cars , and it woul even be faster , as it could avoid traffic jams .
In the second place , public transportatio will prove to be more cost and time effective .
People will be able to save a significant amount of money while travelling in a more time-effective way , as not only will they get to their destinations in less time but they will also be able to read or even work while they are travelling .

In any case , I do not complety agree with the question .
Let me explain better , On one hand , we know the importance that the transnational company cars have for the economy .
The motor industry is one of the most important industries in the world .
So , I suggest that it is impossible to stop the production of the cars , without affecting other fields , or aspects of the economy .
And maybe it could have impredecible effects .
I am not considering the economy as the most important thing , this is not my aim , but unfortunatelly , we have to think on this fact , because we need to have good economy to avoid conflicts in the future .

On the other hand , we have new alternatives to support the impact that the cars have in the planet .
In this point , we should speak about cars that use other kind of energy and more or less have the same capacity to move us .
These cars use gas , or vegetal oil .
We have to assess this point to achieve that the idea of individual freedom remains .

In conclusion , in my opinion it is early to know if in the future there will be more or few cars in the planet , because it is not easy to answer this question .
Usually the people seem to think just in the negative aspects of the cars , forgetting the possitive points of view .
I mean , we have to consider that the car is one important aspect of our common life , and not just for enjoying , but for working or travelling .
I try to explain that , apart from considering the numbers of car , we have to know if it will exist the possibility for avoding the damage that the cars do in the enviroment .

In the fisrt place , simply because the world 's population is growing .
People are having more and more children , and those children get to be adults who can buy their own cars .
Therefore , if the percentage of car owners stay constant , the number of cars will increase .

The second reason I can find to hold my opinion is very much related with the first one .
Since population is growing there are no more space for everyone in the cities , and , thus , living in the city is becoming more and more expensive .
Therefore , nowadays one can choose to have a more cheaper and calm life in the outskirts of the city , and in that way one is able to buy a car and travel to the city to work everyday .

In the third place , I think there is an economical reason for which the number of cars will increase .
Manufacturing tecnhiques are improving , making the construction of a car simpler and cheaper , which makes the final product much more cheaper and accesible .
For example in my grandparent 's time having a car in Argentina was a real privilege for cars were luxury products .
Today , on the contrary , though not everyone can have a car , most of middle class people in Argentina can afford one .

However I also think that there are many different ways in which the number of cars can be regulated .
In my opinion each government should find it 's own way to incentivating people to use alternate means of transportation such as buses or subways to reduce the number of cars .
Clearly the process is not easy but if nothing is done , and the number of cars keeps increasing , then the contamination caused would be really terrible and impossible to correct .

In conclusion I think that if things keep on being the way they are today , in twenty years the number of cars will not be reduced but increased .
Population growth , their need to move out of the cities and to move themselves daily , and the prices on cars are just some reasons I can find to predict such increase .
However , this increase can be reversed if action , mainly form the governments , is taken to regulate the numbers of cars .

"It is difficult to open a newspaper without being faced with a new comment on what will happen in the future with cars .
Nowadays , everybody have their own car , and they use it to go anywhere .
No matter the distance , they need to go by car .
But they do not have a normal car , they have the best one .
Today lot of young people use their savings to buy a new car while they have not paid their house !

Is this issue really that important ?
It is as it has divided society into two different points of view .

On the one hand , a large part of society holds the opinion that cars are a positive thing as they reduce the time people spend at the bus stop .
They argue that they do not have to go to the bus stop , then wait there for , more or less , twenty minutes and finally get off the coach and walk during a long time until their destination .
Going by car let them go faster from their home till where they need .
Besides , having a car gives them more independence .
I mean , they do not have to depend on the schedule of the public transport when they make an appointment .

On the other hand , others feel that so many cars in the town has many drawbacks .
For instance , the number and duration of traffic jams is increasing .
Not only the big cities support this problem , but also the small cities that cannot afford with all those cars .
Moreover , the pollution is becoming a seriously problem .
The atmosphere is being damaged by the pollution .
So we have to be responsible with the environment in order to save our children 's life .

On balance , the number of cars is increasing each day .
That is why I do not agree the statement .
I think that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than today , in spite of the development of planes , trains , and so .
The automobile industry has had an enormous development during the past two decades , and the demand of not only simply cars but also luxury cars is increasing .
",P5,SPA,high,0
"Since the invention of the automobile , civilization as it is known today has skyrocketed .
The liberty that comes with owning a car has stimulated the movement of the world : economically , socially , and technologically .
With each decade , the number of car users has grown exponentially , only to continue growing with the decades yet to come .
The rapid rate of advancement in the automobile world show no signs of stopping .
With this in mind , it is practically impossible to say that in twenty years , less cars will be on the road .
There will be more cars in use around the world than there have ever been before .

Economically speaking , it is nearly impermissible to allow automobile companies to sway .
The world today is dependant on the movement and survival of the car industry for stability .
The future of oil companies , for example , goes hand in hand with the future of the car industry .
The consumer 's awarness of the environment and natural resources pose a threat on the oil industry .
It is only natural that the gas and oil companies worry whenever car businesses consider the public demand for eco-friendly cars .
If the car industry turns to alternative fueling , oil companies are forced to bankrupcy - an option unthinkable in the businessman 's eyes .

Another aspect to consider is the future social situation .
As of today , the westernization of the world is manifested with every McDonald 's placed on the street corner .
Attempts to spread democracy and pull third world countries out of their third world conditions have tremendous impact to the face fo the world .
Roads willl be paved on the backstreets of Nigeria and with that , cars can only follow .
If each underdevelopped country leaps forward in developpement , it will be of no surprise that the car industry sees dramatic improvements as well .

One can already see the how the advancement of the world impacts the growth of car industries .
The two come together ,

"Nowadays , the used of cars is widely spread aroud the world .
Never the less , it is differently distributed depending on the caracteristic of the coutries , and on the level of development .

Some governments are trying to desentivate the use of cars because of pollution , and even to precent accidents .
In addition , some people are looking for other kinds of less expensive ways of transportation , taking into account the increase of oil prizes .

It is very hard to say though , that these governmental and particular initiatives are going to be the same in all the countries and that are going to have the same consequences .

In Europe , with small countries , where there is not enough space , where the cities are crowded and very near to other one , it is relatevily easy to make public policy to decentivate the use of cars .
Indeed sinde the 70's , after the first oil boom , the use of cars , or big cars have decreased .
Governmets promote the use of trains and subways on the main cities .
The space and parking problem in the biggest cities is another reason why people can prefer more are more to use public transportation rather than cars .
In Europe , it is very common to see more and more during the warm seasons the use to bicycles not only to go to college , but also to go to work .
And governments incetivating these kinds of solutions by building bicycles roads .

On the other hand , in places sucn as the United States where the biggest part of the cities are widespread on a several number of kilometers despite their small size , it could be very hard to desincentivate the use of cars even with public policies .

Indeed , only big metropoles such as New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , could easily respond to policies such as those made in Europe .
The traffic is soo messy , and the space so reduce , that in twenty years it would be natural to use fewer cars .
However , in smaller and spred cities , the use of cars is essential .
They do n't face the same problems of space , parking , and pollution of the big metropoles .
Their problem is more about distance , and about oil .

One fact that could really reduce then the number of cars in those places is to face oil scarce and therefore a huge prize raising .
And facing this problem , public policy could be not enough to solve the problem , since those cities are made to ride on a car .

To summarize The use of cars in twenty years can be very different depending on the economic situation of the worl in that moment and on the oil prizes .

"It is sad to say so , but I am afraid it would be completely the opposite .
Not only there will not be fewer cars in twenty years but there will be more cars that our roads , fuel resources and specially , environment will be able to take over .
It seems that in these days everybody has a car , new , second-hand , blue or red , compact or station-wagon , whatever the shape or model , when a young man or woman reaches the appropiate age to drive , they get one car .
And this is specially true in the case of USA , where a person has nothing to do without a car .
Everybody gets a car as soon as possible , not only because it is cheap .
Also because long-distance communications throughout USA may be really good , but that is not the case when it comes to short distances .

Moreover , when you are driving , if you take a look around other cars next to you , what you see is that most cars are only filled with one person .
Maybe most of the people are heading towards the same direction , but nobody agrees to share the car , which will result into less fuel expense and from that into less air pollution .

My opinion is also based on the fact that public transportation is already well developed , except in cities where there is a possibility of building an undergrown net .
I do not see any future perspective of an alternative vehicle but who knows what will happen in twenty years .
Those futuristic films where we could see spaceships floating on the air seem to be very faraway .

It is true that every day there are more low-cost airlines that provide very cheap flights .
But cars will never be replaced for short-distance travels .
There will be more and more cars and this will have a terrible impact on our environment which already damaged by the pollution that cars produce .
The best thing would consist on finding a new type of fuel , based on natural components instead of petrol , a new efficient and friendly-environmen

"From my point of view i do n't think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Even if the price of the oil is enormously increasing nowadays , twenty years is such a small period of time to foresee that cars are going to decrease in use .

As far as i am concerned the car is the transport that most people use to get to the work , the school , the university ...
I am disappointed with this choice because i think the car can tremendously damage the enviroment .
Every day the pollution in the cities are growing and the citizens have the responsability of this .
If we were concerned about the consequences that the cars can cause in the nature I am sure we would change our point of view .
Most people take the car because they think is the easiest way : they ca n't stand the queus in the metro or at the bus stop , they do n't have to fight with the people to get in the train etc .
Instead of seeing the advantages of public transport they only see the disadvantages of it .
However they are wrong because when they take the car there are a lot of people who take the car at the same time , therefore nobody will be able to avoid the traffic-jam in the peak hour .
I ca n't understand why people keep on taking the car in the morning if they know they will find traffic-jam , they will get nervous and maybe they will be late .
Nevertheless at least there are some people concerned about the enviroment problem and they usually take the metro or the bus to move from one place to another .
I would advise the citizens to avoid the car if they do n't really need it .
It is a pity that we are damaging our planet due to our selfishness and carelessness .

"Will there be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years time ?
To answer to this question and determine whether I agree or disagree with the statement in question , first we must consider how several aspects of the world in which we live are going to develop in the future .
Factors such as the world fertility rates , oil prices , development of poor nations , technological improvements and damage to the Earth , have to be taken into account .

We must consider how these various elements will change and interact over twenty years , affecting the numbers of cars in use .
It has been proved that world fertility rates are rising , specially in non developed countries .
This means that the world population will grow during the next twenty years .
Thus , probably , there will be a greater number of potential car buyers .
However , if large numbers of the world population remain poor , they will not have access to cars .

The development of poor nations could raise the standard of living of people which are now poor and cannot afford to buy a car .
This means that in the future , large segments of the population of countries such as India or China could be using cars .
However , this process is uncertain .

On the other hand , factors such as oil price increases or damage to the Earth may the cause the human being to focus on other possible ways of locomotion more cheap and enviromentally friendly .
Perhaps , in twenty years time cars will not exist any longer and we will be using other machines thanks to new technological advancements .

In my opinion , there is a great possibility that emerging nations such as China and India will one day increase their number of car owners .
The development of their economy is raising very rapidly the standard of living of their populations .
In addition , their fertility rates are high .
All this combines to make it very possible that they will have large numbers of car users in twenty years time .
I also believe that human beings will still rely on cars to travel in the long term ; despite the improvements in technology .

"I respectfully disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While guided tours have their merits, traveling independently offers a more enriching and personalized experience for several reasons.

Firstly, traveling solo or in a small group allows for greater flexibility and freedom in choosing where to go and how long to stay at each location. This autonomy enables travelers to explore off-the-beaten-path destinations, interact with locals, and immerse themselves in the culture in a way that may not be possible on a guided tour with a fixed itinerary.

Moreover, independent travel promotes self-discovery and personal growth. Navigating unfamiliar places, making spontaneous decisions, and overcoming challenges on your own can boost confidence and independence. These experiences often lead to a deeper connection with the destination and a greater sense of accomplishment.

Lastly, traveling independently encourages travelers to engage more with their surroundings and connect with the local community. Without the buffer of a tour guide, individuals are more likely to step out of their comfort zone, practice the local language, and form meaningful relationships with residents.

While having a tour guide can provide valuable insights and information about the places being visited, it can also limit the freedom and flexibility of the travelers. 

One of the main benefits of traveling in a group with a tour guide is the convenience of having someone else plan the itinerary and take care of logistics. Tour guides can offer in-depth knowledge about the history, culture, and attractions of a place, enhancing the overall travel experience. Additionally, traveling in a group can provide a sense of security and companionship, especially in unfamiliar or potentially risky destinations.

In contrast, relying on a tour guide can create a sense of dependency and prevent travelers from fully engaging with their surroundings.

While tour guides provide valuable insights and historical context, independent travelers can access information through guidebooks, online resources, and local experts. By conducting their research, travelers can tailor their experiences to their interests and preferences, enhancing their overall travel experience.

Traveling independently empowers individuals to connect more deeply with their destination and themselves, making it the preferable way to explore the world.",P6,SPA,high,1
"I believe that the best way to travel is not necessarily in a group led by a tour guide. While having a tour guide can be beneficial in terms of convenience and access to information, traveling solo or in a smaller group can offer a more authentic and personalized experience.

When you travel in a group led by a tour guide, you may follow a set itinerary that limits your flexibility and spontaneity. In contrast, traveling independently allows you to explore at your own pace, make unexpected discoveries, and engage more deeply with the local culture.

For example, during my recent trip to Italy, I decided to forego a guided tour of Rome and instead wandered the cobblestone streets on my own. I stumbled upon a hidden gelato shop recommended by a local and had the most delicious gelato of my life. This experience would not have been possible if I had been part of a large tour group following a strict schedule.

Moreover, traveling independently can also lead to more meaningful interactions with locals. When you are not part of a large group, it is easier to connect with people on a personal level and gain a deeper understanding of their way of life.

In conclusion, while tour guides can be helpful in certain situations, I believe that the best way to travel is to strike a balance between guided experiences and independent exploration. By doing so, you can create unforgettable memories and truly immerse yourself in the destinations you visit.",P6,SPA,high,1
"Traveling in a group led by a tour guide has its advantages, but it may not necessarily be the best way to travel for everyone. While having a tour guide can provide valuable insights, convenience, and a sense of security, it also comes with limitations and restrictions that may not suit everyone's preferences and travel style.

One of the benefits of traveling with a tour guide is the convenience of having someone else handle all the logistics and planning. The tour guide can take care of accommodations, transportation, and itinerary, allowing travelers to relax and enjoy the experience without worrying about the details. Additionally, tour guides often have in-depth knowledge of the destination, providing valuable information and insights that can enhance the travel experience.

However, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can also limit flexibility and personalization. Group tours often follow a set schedule and itinerary, leaving little room for spontaneity or individual exploration. Travelers may find themselves rushed from one attraction to another, missing out on the opportunity to immerse themselves in the local culture or interact with locals on a more personal level.

Furthermore, being part of a group can sometimes lead to a lack of autonomy and independence. Travelers may feel constrained by the group dynamics and unable to fully experience the destination at their own pace. Additionally, group tours can be more expensive than independent travel, as the cost of the guide and group activities are often included in the package.

In conclusion, while traveling in a group led by a tour guide can offer convenience and valuable insights, it may not be the best way to travel for everyone. The decision to travel with a tour guide should depend on individual preferences, travel style, and the destination being visited. Ultimately, the best way to travel is the way that allows one to have the most authentic and enriching experience, whether that be with a tour guide or independently.

One of the main advantages of traveling with a tour guide is the convenience and ease of having someone else plan the itinerary and handle all the logistics. A tour guide can also provide valuable insights and information about the destinations being visited, enhancing the overall travel experience.

"I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While tour guides can offer valuable insights and information about a destination, traveling independently allows for a more personalized and authentic experience.

Firstly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide often means following a pre-set itinerary, limiting the flexibility to explore off-the-beaten-path locations or spend more time at places of personal interest. Independence in travel allows individuals to tailor their experiences to their own preferences and interests, leading to a more enriching and fulfilling journey.

Furthermore, traveling solo or in a smaller group enables deeper immersion in the local culture. Interacting with locals, navigating public transportation, and discovering hidden gems can provide a more authentic and genuine experience of a destination. These interactions can lead to meaningful connections and a deeper understanding of the place visited.

In addition, traveling independently fosters self-reliance and problem-solving skills. Dealing with unexpected challenges or navigating unfamiliar environments can enhance one's adaptability and confidence, contributing to personal growth and development.

By engaging directly with the local community, trying new foods, and exploring hidden gems, you can gain a deeper appreciation for the destination and create lasting memories that are unique to your own journey.

Traveling independently allows for a more personalized and authentic experience. You have the freedom to tailor your itinerary to your interests, linger in a charming cafÃ© or stumble upon hidden gems off the beaten path. Can a tour guide truly capture the spontaneity and serendipity that make travel so enriching?

Moreover, traveling solo or in a small group can foster a deeper connection with the destination and its people. By navigating unfamiliar streets and engaging with locals on your own terms, you can cultivate a sense of independence and cultural understanding that may be lacking in a guided tour.

"People always have liked to travel , but there are two principal ways to do that , travel in a group led by a tour guide or travel alone .
Both ways have advantages and disadvantages .

When people travel in a group , they have to follow all the instructions of the tour guide .
They have to start and finish the experience at the same hour , and if somebody does not like the rule , he can not do anything for achieve his wish .
There is no freedom .
For example , in the Rome 's tour , there is not time to visit all the places in the city , the tour only visits the Coliseum and The Vatican .

However , if you like the speech from the tour guide , you can enjoy the experience a lot , because you do not have to look for the interesting sites and its history or its data , the tour guide provides it them to you .
This way to travel is so easy and comfortable .

Altough many people prefer the way to travel alone , because they do not have to follow another group .
They decide all that they will do by themselves .

They use a map , a tourists book or the advices of some friends .
They visit all the places that they want and stay there one day or one year .
In this way to travel you can spent your time or your money in your deepest wishes , your doubts about some places and cultures or attending your necessities .

In my opinion , I think that it is the best way to travel , because I have the freedom to chose what site I will visit , what food I will eat , what time I will spent and at what hour I will wake up and I will start my experience .

"The best way to travel is not necessarily in a group led by a tour guide .
There are different definitions as to what `` traveling '' really is ...
A person might travel for business purposes as well for pleasure .
The interpretation of this question is key to obtaining a proper answer .
None of the above require a group or a tour guide .

People often prefer to travel as comfortable as they can .
By this , it can be meant that people will travel according to what they want to do and what they need to get done .
For example , if a person wants to go on a vacation with his family , that person will organize the trip and customize it to his or her preferences .
That person will not be led by a tour guide that will tell the group where to go and what to see .
The reason why the business and pleasure traveling was metntioned above was because of the misinterpretation one might have when reading the question .

Not all traveling requires a group or a tour guide .
Depending on what thd person 's purposes for traveling is for is that he or she will make their decisions ion .
The only case in which a tour guide would be needed is if the group choses to acquire one instead of being led by their group leader , or if there is no information acquired by the group as to the region or location that they will be traveling to , meaning that they would definitely need a tour guide in order to learn about the place .

By mentioning the types of traveling and situations , you might find that it is n't necessary for one to hire a tour guide in order to lead a group .
With the proper research one is able to lead a group to their accomodations within their vacation or travel stay and make it the best possible vacation without the use of a travel guide at any given time .

Some times even the idiom is strange to you .
It 's possible that by mistake you ended up in risky places where you can be assalted .
These are some risks that people like me do n't want to have , so the answer for them is to travel in a tour .
Because tour 's are composed of many people and are led by a local guide who knows the zone , you can be almost sure that nothing bad will happen to you .

Furthermore , lonely travelers have to ask for interesting places in each city they go .
They will visit some places , but probably they will miss others .
When traveling in a tour , all the places are known by the agency , and they usually give you the best of each town .
You dont waste time asking for advice and you do n't miss important places .

Finally , although tour agencies seem to be expensive .
In my opinion , they ended up being cheaper .
When you travel by yourself , you can make some good deals .
Nevertheless , very often people are cheated by local sellers , and they do n't become aware of this because they simply do n't what is the correct prize .
These events never happen in tours .
They know where they work , and the correct prize .
Thay charge you some extra money for this knowledge , but it 's worth it .

For example , if one plans to travel and visit Ancient Rome , Ancient Greece , Egypt etc , one might evaluate the option of having a tour guide .
The tour guide , being a person that is familiar with such sorroundings will definitely take the person to visit and enjoy such famous landmarks that are worh traveling for .
One has a pre-organized schedule of those places to be visited , therefore making great use of time .
Everything is basically under control leaving time for excitement , satisfaction and fun .
Most of the time , tour guides help the person learn and enrich themselves personally with specific accounts on the place that is being visited .
It enriches one , not only educationally , but can also be plenty worth the time .

On the other hand , when one decides to travel without a tour guide , one might be seeking , action , adventure , curiosity .
On might intend to explore the sense of discovering things and places that has n't been seen before .
Then again it is up to the person to `` get out there '' and find the things that will make a trip worthwhile and exciting .
No one handles the travelers time except him/her .
They decide where to go , how to get there and when to go , making it then more intrinsic and inspirational when its time to make the best of it and of course make the memories long-lasting and cherishable .
So , when it comes to whether choosing or not a tour guide to accompany a traveler on its trip , it must depend on what the person seeks and strives to acknowledge , live and learn along the course of his / her exciting journey .

"I do n't think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide because :

First , the routes of the guided trips are general standarized .
The visits and intineraries are already studied and planned by the tour guide so there is a chance you can miss an important site or place .
I think the best way to make a trip is by buying guides published by a well know brand like Lonely Planet .
This guides are full with tips , facts , history , hotels recommendations , restaurants , bars , etc .

Second , in most of the guided tours you will have limited free time since you need to follow a schedule .
For example , after visiting a church or temple , a museum ...
you will only have 2 hours of free time .
I believe that with this much of free time you can slightly see the city .
In general , all the hotels that tour trips reserve includes breakfast and generally you will have to wake up early .
What if I want to wake up late and have breakfast in a typical restaurants recommended by the locals ?

By travelling in a group you relly on other people tastes .
Maybe one member asks the guide to visit a toy factory .
What if I do n't want to go there ?

Other reason is that not all of the tour guides are well prepared .
In my experienice with tour guides I had some good and some bad .
Ocassionally some tour guides even lie or just make up facts to make the tour more appealling .

And finally , what if I do n't get along with somebody in the group ?
or maybe he asks too many irrelevant questions that may delay the an activity

I had travelled in both ways , in a tour group with a guide and with just my friends and a book as a guide .
I find the second more enjoyable since you mark your own pace , intinerary , and the best of all , you choose the people to go with .

"I would have to say that the best way to travel is being your own tour guide .
I personally like to explore places by myself , I am curious and I am not afraid to take risks .
To me sounds boring just to think about the idea of traveling with a group of people and depend on somebody else 's schedule and not on my own .

When people travel with a tour guide they usually depend on the guide 's schedule during the whole trip , and that could be one of the inconveniences .
For example , in a group of people of different ages , the older ones would agree with some situations while the younger probably would not .
If they have to follow a guide they have no choice to change the schedule and avoid doing things or going to places where they are not comfortable .

Personally , when I travel somewhere , I like to explore the place by myself , get a map , take a train and find places without having to follow somebody that already knows where to go and what to do .
If I end up getting lost in an unknown place it is not a problem for me , on the other hand , it is fun !
I like to explore cultures by knowing how their people behave .
For example , during my last trip to Rome I discovered the most friendly people I have ever had contact with before .
I was lost for 3 hours , and even though I had a map and I knew how to find my way , I started asking for directions to people on the road , and I really loved the fact that they would stop no matter for how long and talk to me , try to help me in the most friendly way , and that is an experience I really enjoyed .
To me , that is the only way someone can really enjoy visiting a new place : taking risks and exploring .

It is also more expensive to travel having a touristic guide .
Sometimes we save money for a long time to get a chance to travel somewhere and it is not worth it to spend a considerable amount of that money paying somebody who is going to show us the place and probably talk about relevant historical passages of that part of the world if we are able to get a book and read about the same topic and take a train or any transportation media to get wherever we want by ourselves .

The best way to travel is to go without planning too much .
In my opinion it is more exciting the unexpected : being in a new place , getting to talk to local people , following my own schedule without having to think about what time is it , discover places by myself and have a really fun story to remember forever .

"Man have travelled for as long as he has lived in society .
The characteristic of most of today 's travelling is that it is motivated not by economic or political necessity , but by pleasure .
Leisure and this search for pleasure is at the root of the tourism industry .
Understanding the sources of this pleasure provides a solid base to comprehend the best ways to travel .

Where is a person 's pleasure in travelling rooted ?
I believe in curiosity : in being exposed to new situations , enjoying beautiful scenery , getting to know different ways of living , and being a part of other customs and cultures .
It is important to note that the satisfaction of this curiosity is greater when it emerges from personal discoveries .
The best way to travel is , hence , the one which favors and maximizes the satisfaction of curiosity in these two dimensions .

Travelling can be led by a tour guide , or simply alone - in group or individually .
In order to decide which is best , one must ponder the new things one would like to see and learn , on one part , and the possibility of discovering these individually , on the other .
Unfortunately , frequently these do not imply each other , meaning that waiting to discover the marvels of the places a person travels to generally takes time and energy , limiting the places and important things one visits and sees .
The choice of travelling with a guide permits maximizing the experiences , knowledge and sightseeing , but generally minimizes the possibility of discovering these individually .

Considering these , I prefer travelling with a tour book that introduces me on the most important sightseeing and culture enrichening experiences , but does not hinder the possibilities of running off track for some time and discover new things personally .
This is the way I travelled Central America last summer , and it was certainly a gratifying experience .
I have also travelled led by a tour guide - to Cuzco and Macchu Picchu , Peru - and although it was a great experience , being able to discover things by yourself as you travel is truly rewarding .
I have also travelled alone , to Bolivia , but at many times I felt I did not know where to go .

Travelling with a book , instead of a tour guide - in group or individually - seems to maximize the often antithetic sources of pleasure in travel : exposure to new surprising experiences and scenery and the satisfaction of personal discoveries .

"I agree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide if the destination is one that 's new to you .

If one is visiting a country for the first time , and especially if one doesnt know how to speak the native language , and is completely unfamiliar with the visiting location , it is best to go with a tour guide .
Tour guides are very qualified and have a lot of knowledge about the country 's history , customs , food , traditions , culture and must-see monuments .
They also provide useful help regarding hotels and good eating and entertainment locations .
This is very beneficial because not only one sees and experiments a new country , but also one gets to know about it , to grow as a person and as a citizen , expanding one 's horizons getting to see more than meets the eye , experiencing the history of the place , the way people behave and live in that specific place , one gets to feel embraced by the country and its culture in a way that engages you to it , in a way you 'll never forget and hardly will experience again .

The first time I visited Italy and learned about its artists , its culture , music and history i fell in love with it , the first time I got to interact with its people I was certain I would come back one day and live the rest of my life there , in Italy , in Rome ...
I learned that there 's more to Italy than a Colliseum , there 's more than the language and there 's more than the famous ` gondolas ' to it , it 's what 's behind all those creations , the thoughts , the magic , the inspiration and the passionate drive what makes that country so beautiful , passionate and perfect in my eyes .
That 's why I belive it is better to travel with a tour guide , it takes you farther , you get to travel not only with your body , but with your heart and mind .

However , if the destination is a place one 's already familiar with , and specially if one 's traveling with a partner , or in a honeymoon , it would be much more comfortable to go as a couple , without any tour guides , rediscovering the country by one 's own means and visiting the places one wants to visit , not necessarily the most visited and popular places , but for instance , one 's favorite restaurant , one that probably not much people know about , but that it 's excellent and brings back beautiful memories .
Also if one 's traveling with the whole family , especially with small kids , it would be very difficult to pay attention to the tour guide without being interrupted by a tantrum and fights between brothers and sisters , so it would not be the best idea to go with a tour guide .

For instance , I am from Venezuela even though I 'm living in the US , and I think I know pretty much everything about my country , so visiting my country with a tour guide wouldnt make much sense to me , since I already know it and the places I like to visit and that are so special to me , and it would only take time from me visiting my best friends and my family , all of whom live there , and since my point of visiting would be to see my friends and family again , having a tour guide would only be an obstacle in the way of enyoying my trip , therefore it wouldnt be beneficial for me in any sense .

To conclude , I think its a great idea to visit a country with a tour guide if that place is new to you and you would like to know and learn about it , nurturing your mind .
However if its a place that 's already familiar to you , it would be much more enyoyable to go with a partner and enjoy the country as you know it .

"I disagree with the statement that is best to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
When you travel with groups and guides there are only predetermined places you can go to , and also spend a precise amount of time in each activity .
These are the main reasons why I prefer to travel on my own .

I think that if you travel by yourself , you are not subject to a specific schedule , also you can organize yourself in a more convenient way .
Sometimes you feel like staying in the hotel and rest or do something totally different than the rest of the group .
Also it can happen that you do not get a great and cheerful group of people and that can contribute to some tension among travelers .

Several years ago , I went to Brazil in a tour with several friends , and ofcourse , we thought that having a tour guide would be the best thing to do .
Initially was o.k. , but at the end became a nightmare because we wanted to do other things that were not part of the guided tour routine .
For example , we wanted to go to Buzios , a small town with amazing beaches and a lot of natural sites to visit .
Unfortunately , and because the tour guide refused to take us there , we were not able to visit Buzios .

Some nights we also felt like going to different and more exiting places or stay longer at others , but , we were reminded of the policies in place .
Guided tours are very restrictive , and because of this and other experiences I have had in the past , I believe that traveling on your own is the best move .

"It is very common to see people traveling to different interesting places in the world being led by a tour guide .
My essay will talk about why I would really prefer to travel by myself instead of doing it in group and hiring a tour guide .

First of all , you can easily notice that people who usually travel in a group led by tour guides are people who invest more money in their trips .
That means that the economic factor plays an important role in this matter .
For example , people who travel to Europe and have enough money to pay a guide would prefer to do this because it would save them not only time , but also effort to think how to plan a good trip .
In my personal opinion , I would rather prefer to invest my money in the trip and not in a person I do n't really need .

Secondly , the age is a predominant factor in this decision , as well .
In most of the cases , young people would prefer to travel by themselves to give the trip a little adventure .
On the other hand , it is rare to see old people adding adventure to their experiences .
They only want to get the best of their trip without caring about fun .

Finally , and most importantly , people will enjoy the trip more if they feel independent to take their own decisions .
That 's what really matters on a trip , having fun and feeling free to do what you want when you decide to .
To give you an example , when I had the opportunity to travel to Argentina for work purposes , we were offered a trip to a beautiful village .
It was an incredible place and there were plenty of things to do there .
However , since we were supposed to follow the scheduled program defined by a tour guide , we were not able to enjoy and to know the place as if we were there by ourselves .
In other words , traveling by myself is by far the best decision I could make .

"I totally agree with the statement , the best way to to have a nice travel is to go in a group and also to have a good tour guide .
When we think about the possibility to do a travel we have to consider differents aspects one of those is the place where we want to go , also if it is good to be alone or in group and also , what we want to do on that place and how to do it .

First , went we choose a place of dentination we have to consider aspects like the time that we have .
When we do a travel in a group all the activities are very coordinated .
The travel led by a tour are the best idea when you want to know a new place .

The tour guide is the person specialides on this kind of jobs because they have the knowledge of the place that you want to visit , that have a clear understanding of the history of that place , also the right places to visit , what to eat and what to buy as a souvenir .
they give a comprehensive tour for that place that you want to know completly .

For example the last weekend i went to Mexico with a goup of frients and we have just few days to enjoy the new country and also to have contact with the city and the people .
So the best ideas was to take a tour by the city with a specilized person , The city was Guanajuato , and this place of the country has a rich history to meet .
That tourist guide really know about the city .
He explained about the historica aspects of this city , we went to the target places to the city and also we took the most beautiful picture in the especial places , because of his orientation .
It was an amazing travel , and we did that travel in just one day ; Definilly to hire that person was the best ideas because in other way we could not see all that we did .
I met to the mommis , the callejon of the kiss , the statu of the pipila , and more .

So in my personal opinion and depending on which plan you travel the best idea is to go in a group because you can reduce costs on your travel , you have the opportunity to meet new people , and you enjoy more also the tour guide is an important key to get a complete knowledge of the new place .

Depening of what kind of person you are , you choose the sort of travel that you want to do but the most important thing is to enjoy the new experience .
",P6,SPA,high,0
"I think that in a certain way you can learn more from places if you go with a tour guide but probably will not be much funnier than going with your friends .

Also if you go with a tour guide you need to wake up at an specific time and be at that moment in the place he told you or if not you will missed that trip .
I think that if i want to travel to a place i will need to analyze for what purpose i want to go .
If I want to go only for pleasure or if i really want to know the turistic places and their history .

Probably I will decide to travel with friends but i will go to the tourism offices to get information about the touristic places of the city and select which places we like the most and visit them .
If the place will require a tour guide we will pay for it if not we will only enjoy the place and the moment .

Sometimes going with a tour guide makes you feel bore because you cannot go to eat or sleep at the time you want because you need to finish the program he have .

But for example if I go to a city for few hours or only for a day i will choose to go with a group led by a tour guide because probably if i go by myself i will not have enough time to visit many places and know the city .

In other words i can say that if you want to stay for many days in a place you can go visit places that seems interesting for you and later pay for the attention of a tour guide to talk you about the history of the city .

"I do not think that the best way to travel is with a group led by a tour guide .
First , If you limit yourself to the movements and decision of one group , say of people from your own country , you may not be able to know the locals and learn from their worldviews and traditions .
How many time have you seen a packed group of tourists interacting only among themselves and thinking that the guide 's opinions and beliefs represent the opinion and feelings of all the community ?
When visiting another country or place , I like melting with the locals , meeting as many people as I can and learning directly from their everyday actitivies and their own ideas .
Second , you may think that tour guiding visits are more informative or convinient in terms of time and money .
However , truth is that many times guided-tours are more expensive and time consuming than individual , self-informed visits .
Tour guides in Costa Rica for example usually charge excessive amounts of money to tourists for activities that would not be so expensive if done alone or with the help of a local friend .
Depending on the site you are visiting , in a guided-tour you will only get the information that has been included in the guide 's `` menu '' and , sometimes , this information may not be as accurate as you think .
For examples , in Costa Rica many times tour guides are brought from a different place just because they know the language of the tourists or because they have more education than locals .
They were not born in the place or city where they work and , therefore , they frequently do not know all the particular details of the place or its hidden history .
Guided-tours are usually only offered in certain schedules that may not be the most suitable for your interests .
Besides , you may fall into the trap of overplanning your trip , and end up stressed by the pressures of getting up early to catch the shuttle or having to comply with time-limited breaks for breakfast , lunch or going to the bathroom .
Finally , in guided-tours you have to follow the pace of the group when walking around the halls of a museum or an old church .
If alone , you can stop whenever you want , skip what you considere unimportant or just going somewhere else .
Definitely , guided-tours and traveling in a group is not as fascinating as traveling on your own , having the time to interact with locals , taking certain risks that will definitely enrich your experience abroad and will give you enough material to entertain your friends and family back at home .

"WHEN YOU TRAVEL IN A GROUP LED BY A TOUR GUIDE YOU WILL KNOW THE MOST COMMON PLACES THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND FAMILIAR FOR MOST OF PEOPLE .
THIS WAY OF TRAVELING HAS MANY ADVANTAGES BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL THINGS PLANNED AND YOU DONT HAVE TO THINK ON SOLVING CERTAIN PROBLEMS THAT YOU COULD HAVE WHEN TRAVELING , LIKE FOOD , HOTEL AND TRANSPORTATION TO ALL PLACES YOU WANT TO SEE .
IF YOU HAVE TO GET TICKETS FOR AN IMPORTANT EVENT OR SHOW YOU WIILL NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS TO GET THEM .
BESIDES , YOU ARE SPENDING YOU TIME WITH OTHERS AND YOU WILL BE SAFE IN CASE OF VISITING A DANGEROUS COUNTRY .
IN ADDITION , YOU WILL HAVE SPECIFIC TIMES FOR EVERY ACTIVITY YOU DECIDE TO TAKE AND THE WARRANTY THAT YOU HAVE A SAFE SPACE IN EVERY TRANSPORT YOU NEED TO TAKE .
THOSE ARE THE GOOD REASONS YOU HAVE FOR TRAVELING IN A TOUR GUIDE .

IN MY CASE I CONSIDER THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL IS WHEN YOU DO IT BY YOURSELF AND YOU PLAN ALL PLACES YOU WANT TO VISIT AND THE TIMES YOU LIKE TO SPEND ON EVERY ONE .
I DO NOT LIKE TO BE TIED TO OTHERS LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE TO BE AT SPECIFIC TIME AT A CERTAIN PLACE BECAUSE I THINK IT IS BETTER WHEN YOU ARE SPONTANEOUS AND YOU ACT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES .
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GOT A PLACE THAT YOU REALLY LIKED IF YOU WERE IN A GROUP YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT MOST OF THE GROUP WANT AND YOU ARE NOT FREE TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO .
WHEN VISITING A DIFFERENT COUNTRY THE BEST WAY OF KNOWING IT IS BY GOING TO MANY PLACES AND NOT ONLY TO VISIT THE MOST POPULAR ONES .
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REAL FOOD , THE ACTUAL ECONOMICAL SITUATION AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART , THE PEOPLE , YOU SHOULD GO TO COMMON PLACES NOT FOR THE TOURISTS BUT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE COUNTRY .
IF YOU WANT TO LEARN OR PRACTICE THE LANGUAGE YOU SHOULD GO TO PLACES WHERE THERE IS NO HELPING PEOPLE TO DO THE THINGS AND SPEAK FOR YOU IN CASE OF NEEDING IT .

IN A WORD , I AGREE THE BEST WAY OF TRAVELING IS WHEN YOU DO IT BY YOURSELF AND DO THE THINGS YOU WANT TO WITHOUT CONSIDERING ASKING OTHER PEOPLE AND VISITING ONLY THE POPULAR PLACES THAT YOU WILL NOT KNOW VERY WELL BECAUSE OF TIME AND PEOPLE YOU ARE TRAVELING WITH .
I DO NOT LIKE TOUR GUIDES .

"I agree with this statement based on my experience of traveling .
First of all if you contract a guide you can be sure that you are hiring an expert in what you are a complete ignorant and therefore he will do it , for sure , twice as good as you .

To begin with a very good reason of choosing a guide we can say that it will be cheaper because he knows the place and cost of the attractions and in case you want to see a show that is held in two different establishments at the same time he could recommend you the cheaper , furthermore the decrease in other expenses like lodging , food , etc. will surely yield that the money you are wasting in your tourist guide will be less than the money you are saving .

Other important reason is that you wo n't get lost , for example , once when I visited Barcelona I did n't want to get a guide because we only had a few hours to stay in the town , my surprise was when we almost lost half of the time looking for a monument instead of taking advantage of the amazing harbor or other events there .

The last advantage of having this person in a tourist group is that he knows the city and he will warn you of certain dangerous zones of the city or disabled roads , a personal reference of this reason has happen to me a year ago when my family and I went for vacations in Seattle , we were walking in downtown without a guide and admiring the amazing skyscrapers of the city when suddenly we realized that it was getting dark , and of course we did n't know that that zone inthe night is a little creepy ( of course , no map warns you about that ) and when we decided to go back to the car we were in the middle of hundreds of welfare people begging for money , fortunately no disasters happened to us but it was a lesson that I will never forget .

My conclusion would be that a guide is best investment you can make in a tour

"in my opinion you have to consider a lot of things for when you are traveling this all different things will affect where you go and how you spend your time wherever you will go .

in my opinion traveling in a group led by a tour guide has a lot of good and bad things .
the good things are that you get to see museums to learn about a lot of stuff of the place you are visiting it is also easier to travel with someone that knows the place you are going and who can understand the language of the place they are going .
but you are also limited to the number of things you can do or the number of places you can go if you were with no tour guide .

on the other hand traveling in a group with no tour guide has many positive and many negative things .
some of the positive things have to do with the night life you can go wherever you want at whatever time you want , you can change plans whenever you want like if you planned to go to italy and in the last minute you decided you want to go to germany instead then you would just by a plane ticket that easy !!!

some of the bad things is that you could get lost or something could happen to you and there was nothign you could do if you didnt have someone who knew the place and spoke the same language .

in my opinon the best way to travel is with no tour guide because i like taking risks and going to places by myself .

"I disagree with the statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
I disagree mainly by three reasons .
First , even though the tour guide is an specialist in the zone or city that you are going to visit and you can get a more complete knowledge of that zone or city , I think that a good book of the city can supply in a correct way the knowledge of the tour guide .
A good book have history of the city , routes of interest , architectural and archeological points to visit and legends of the city among other things .
Using a book of the city in your travel can help you both to acquire the knowledge that you would acquire with the tour guide and to plan the route to follow .

Second , when you travel with a tour guide , you have the schedules restriction .
For example the plan says 8 am breakfast , 9 am visit to the museum , 1 pm eating ...
And you have to respect the schedule .
You do not have enough freedom .

On the other hand , when you travel without a tour guide , you can assign the time that you want to the different activities .
If you want , you can get up more late in the hotel , or if the visit to the museum is bored , you can end the visit and go to drink a coke or visit other thing .
In other words , you can assign the time to every activity , and not be restricted by an schedule .
You can enjoy the places by the time that you want , no by the time that a tour guide wants .

Third , traveling with a tour guide , restrict you the route or itinerary .
For example your travel can be limited to 7 or 8 places and you can not add or quit a place .
Traveling with a tour guide will allow you to decide wich places to visit .
Your travel will not be limited by a determined number of places .
If you want you can add or quit places to visit , the route is not fix .
You can visit the places that most attracts your attention .

In conclusion , for me is more exciting to travel without a tour guide because I can get more freedom in my travel and I can decide which places to visit and for how many hours .
I am not limited by the schedules or routes of a tour guide .

"From my personal experience the best way to travel is not by being led by a tour guide , it 's better to plan your own journey .
It is true that its not an easy process , but you have much more benefits .
For example , the money is a perfect factor to talk about .
Some agencies often charge you to much money to organize your trip , and it could not be a god idea to loose all that money when you could save the 50 percent of what you spent .
You have different stategies to find solutions .
For example , involving places to stay , such as hostels that you find in the internet that are cheper .
The experience is one of the most important elements of planning your own trip .
The process of making your own desicions and going whear ever you want can become really fun .
Last summer I went to Europe and went to Spain , France and Germany .
I organized the hole trip , day by day and it becamed a real success .
It is true that problems occured during the trip , but I think that those are part of the things that creates the adventure of the experience .

Another factor is that most agencies already have the cities in wich they are going to travell , so you do n't have many choices to explore .
On the other hand , the liberty of my schedule gave me the oportunity of even going to England for just a couple of days and in a short notice .
The schedule is led by you and not by anyone else , giving you the liberty in a place whear you had never gone to .
There is no better feeling than being in a huge place were time is not a factor and liberty is taken .
In a sense you feel so small and alone in a enormous continent but ironicly you become stronger and bigger as all the experiences satisfy your expectations .

So in general I think that backpagging is an experience that every human being must have in his life .
There is adventure , clueless bahaviours and surprises that a tour guide could not offer you .

Suddenly , I woke up crying and screaming .
I could n't believe it , I had had a bad dream .
Before , I realized that dream had a profound effect on my feelings .
The dream was about a trip where I got lost and there was nobody next to me .
I was afraid !! .
I agree with the statement that says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
The reasons why I agree with that are my personal experience of traveling alone and the cost

First , one of the reasons to travel with a group is my personal experience .
I went to Brazil alone and I did n't enjoy it so much .
I realized that I do n't like traveling with no people .
All the trips should be done with people who you care alot .
Moreover , I would like to visit others places like Bolivia and Chile , both countrys from South America .
But , I 'd go with my close friends .
One who spends with their relatives or lovers have fun more than one who spends time alone in a foreign country .

Futhermore , the cost is another reason why I think that taking a guide for your group trip is a good idea .
Visitors spend more money going by themselves to an unknown place .
If you have a guide , he or she is going to tell you where you should go to eat delicious native meals .
Also , he or she can tell you the cheaper restaurant in the city or town .
In adittion , everytime you travel with a group , the discos and taverns are the favorite places to have fun .
There , you can dance and drink all you want with less money .

In conclusion , the best way to travel is with a tour guide .
He or she can show you where to go , where to eat and where to have fun without paying big amount of money .
Other way to travel is doing it with a group .
To be in a foreign country alone is not agood idea because something could happen to you .
Moreover , being with your bestfriends or maybe with your family makes the trip more exciting and unforgetable .

"I do agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
The first reason is because you could know exactly what is your schedule about time and places .
It is important because I could obtain , before the trip , some information which will help me during my tour .
For example , if a tour goes through a few museums , I could have information related to artists , paintings and sculptures .
It will help me to understand in a better way what things I am discovering and looking at .
Furthermore I will have a foundation to ask some questions for achieving a deep comprehension .

Another reason to take a tour is I could take advantage of the trip moment by moment .
It permits me to know more new things and cities into a short periods of time .
Therefore I will not miss any detail of a tour .

Besides to travel into a group led by a tour is more confortable because I will not be worried of certain facts , as for example : Booking hotels , arranging travel tickets , looking for the best transportation ways , contracts , among others .

The last reason , and maybe the most important for me , is that this kind of trip allows me to meet other people with the same interests such as to discover new cultures , to admire beautiful cities and countries , and to increase our general knowledge about the world .
Furthermore I cou A tour guide has a special preparation of several subjects and if we have a question , we will have always his support during the trip .

These are important reasons to support why I do not like travel by myself and how much I could enjoy a trip by sharing my time with other people without to be stressed by certain things which could be in the proffesional people 's hands .

When you first travel to a new country it is important to find someone that can take you to the places that you can not miss in your trip .
Eventhough you can get some knowledge from books and Internet about the cities and important places , tour guides give you the exact information you need to know such as theorical facts but also myths , leyends and beliefs , which many times are more interesting and not found in books .

Besides city knowledge , traveling with a goup of people is a very interesting activity because you get to know new persons with different characteristics which help you understand different cultures , attitudes and ways of thinking .
For example , the first time I traveled to Europe I did it with a big group of people , although they were all mexicans I realized there are a lot of different customes in my own country .
It was a great experience because it encouraged new friendships .

Finally , respect is a value well-related with this kind of trips .
Time is an important aspect .
A lot of times we do not think about people 's time , but in this kind of trip everyone depends in the other so punctuallity is a very important topic .
There I understood an excellent frase from an argentian economist named David Konsevic : `` Never take people 's time , when you do this you are taking part of their lives '' .
Not only time but also respect for people 's beliefs and customes which in many cases are different from ours and some times hard to understand .

In conclusion , by experience I can support the statement which mentions that traveling with a group led by a tour guide is best way to do this activity because of better city knowledge , fun and learning to respect people 's time and beliefs .

"I think that the best way to travel is with someone who knows what they are talking about .
When you travel , the main point is to learn from this new place and its culture .
If one is to go by themselves then how is one learning , if the point of a trip is to learn and see ?
Of course , a guide may not be much fun at times but there are trips where you have time off to do your own thing and have fun .

When one goes on a trip , one does not know all the main things that are available .
Since it is a new place one does not know where the best food is , or where the best stores are , or even where the most importand and beautiful places are .
If this happens how will the trip be any fun at all ?
What if you go to the wrong place to eat .
It may be an adventure but not a necessary sacrifice for what is supposed to be a fun travel .
A guide 's job is to teach the turist about the place they are visiting and give them a brief description of the place .
A tour guide is an expert in this which means that one will get the right information .

Traveling with a group of people is not only fun but beneficial since the discovering can be greater with more people putting their thoughts in the discovery .
It is true that starting from scratch may give a more detailed and comprehensive idea of the place , but this is not something that is done in a short amount of time which is why having a tour guide is much easier .
The group will learn together and the tour guide will teach what is necessary and in the free time offered one can ask the guide for places that are known are save and where one can make small personal impressions about the place being visited .

Traveling with a group led by a tour guide is very beneficial .
The tour guide is an expert who knows what he or she is talking about .
The tour guide will give all the necessary and most important information about the place being visited .
The group would make the trip a fun travel because one gets to meet people and have fun with learning at the same time .
Basically , I do agree with the satatement that the best way to travel is to be in a group with a good tour guide .

"Traveling is for me the best way to get to know newpeople and their culture .
By traveling you will know different places and experience the trip in your own skin is something that you will never forget .
You can read many books about a particular place but it is only when you travel that you understand the culture , architecture , etc. of that place .

Many people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide and I totally disagree with that statment .
I think that the best way to travel is on your own with a map .
I have several reasons for holding that opinion .
First of all , traveling in groups with a tour guide does not give you the freedom to move around that you might want .
When you travel by yourself you decide where to go and when .
For example I remmember when I traveled in a group of fifteen persons with a tour guide in Paris four years ago .
I planned and scheduled all my trip with this group and its guide because I did not want to travel alone .
It turned out that I had a really bad experience with them .
I was required to get up very early in the morning because the excursions started at sunrise .
Imagine that experience for me that I am not a morning person ! .
Moreover I did not get along with the people in the group .
There was a big age difference that conditioned all our decisions .
When I wanted to go to a pub at night the rest of the group preferred to stay at the hotel playing cards .
I think they did n't realize they were in Paris .

Secondly , traveling in groups with guide is far more expensive than traveling by yourself .
You can decide where to eat and how much you want to spend if you travel alone .
You know the amount of money that you have and you know how you want to spend it .
For example , you can decide to pay a boat around the river instead of paying a museum .

To sum up I think that traveling alone far outweigh the fact of traveling in groups .
I must also say that the information that a tour guide can give you during the trip can also be found in many travel guides and books .
So you might want to read a little bit before departuring .

"From every travel , what we get at the end are just a group of memories .
Events , things learned , people met , and lots of specific information that may be with us until we leave this world .
A tour guide is an effective and excellent way to ensure a quality trip , and what better than a great trip with friends and family !

My family is a huge fan of tour guides and is obsessed with traveling always together .
`` We all go , or nobody goes '' my mom usually says when somebody is planning a trip on his own .
They always say that the trip is not even worthwhile without the two key ingredients : a good group and a good guide .
I sometimes wonder myself if they would rather leave me and take a guide to all of the trips we have made in our lifetime .
I have to say , regardless of the weird obsession my parents have for guides , I agree with them .
Having a guide helps you understand the history and the people of the place you are visiting .
You can get recommendations for good places to eat , fun parks to visit , and interesting museums and shows .
And best of all , share all this with the company you have !

On a trip I made to Europe two years ago ( obviously with every member of my family ) , I went to see a city that hundreds of years ago had been covered in lava , and completely destroyed .
The first thing my father did when we arrived at thhis amazing place , was to look for the best guide he could find .
I think regular parents first take a look at the place , read something about them , and probably go buy the tickets to enter ; but not my dad .
In less than five minutes he came with a spanish guide that had studied history in a prestigious university , and spoke around six languages .

Although I make fun of my parents ' obsession , I have to say that in every trip we make we have the best tour guides a tourist can possibly get .
I should probably thank them for getting the best out of every place we visit , because that is really priceless .

In conclusion , I would like to say that groups and guides are an incredible combination for every trip .
It gives you people to talk and have fun with , and the touch of history and education we should all receive .

"Travelling to a new place can be very exciting especially if done by group .
The best way to get to know a new place is by having the opinion of someone who knows what to show , but a tour guide can be very monotonous and tedious if you want to explore .

If you were to go in a group of people to a new city , travelling with a tour guide can be safe and interesting .
The guide can show you the local attractions such as a church , cathedral even a local bar , but it is way more fun if you go on your own , and experience the church maybe even pray a little ; go to the cathedral and look at the things that you want to look at and not what the guide wants to show you ; and get to a bar and sit and enjoy with the locals and not with the guide and the group who are usually in a hurry .

Another good reason for going on your own , is that you can always stop wherever you want and feel free to shop , visit , stop , eat , drink and do almost anything .
A guide will always tell you or induce you into what to do or what to look at .

If you were to plan a visit to your personal sightings , because there is a reason that motivated you to go to a certain place , you will do it in your own schedule , at your own time and rhythm .
Plan when and where you will eat .
When you 'll come back to your hotel and arrange your day according to your interests .
Meanwhile , the guide will look for the best schedule to do as much as possible in one day , try not to leave anything out , plan where and when you will eat , and most important look-out for the group 's interest which is not always your own .

Finally , a very important and problably exciting reason to go on your own and not with a guide , is that you can meet people in your visit and end up leaving with that person to visit other locations and getting to know the place through someone else 's eyes .
Or if you travel with your couple , it would be romantic to walk and visit together and not with a guide or the group .

As you can conclude , travelling by yourself to a new place is much better than with a guide .
It is personal , exciting , and most important , adequate to your best interests .

"Every trip is different , and every trip should be different .

Some may see guided tour groups as an effective way of missing the actual `` spirit '' of a place , be it an archeological site , a small village off the beaten path , or a modern urban centre .
Tour guides always seem to be in a rush , and not really interested in supporting the creation of an emotional link to the place you are visiting .
They just repeat a bunch of facts , dates and statistics , compressing what took may be hundreds of years to be made into a five minutes `` instant memory '' .

You better bring your camera , if you are to tell yourself later that you actually put your feet on the famous place you so badly wanted to know .

That might be the point of view of a youngster , a man in his early twenties , ready to take on the world and its many hidden treasures .
But what if you are a fifteen years old girl with a free ticket to any destination , or to that matter a fifty years marriaged coupled ready to retire for a while ?
Is it that clear that they should go and endure a whole trip , with its many surprises and probably challenging moments ?

Tour guides should not be regarded as the only way to gaining access to a particular destination and its features , but as a key agent in getting in contact with the place and people you are visiting .
There are different types of guided tours , and you can always get some literature about the place you are traveling to .
Be sure to choose the tour that fits best your actual desire and capacity to visit a foreign wonder .

It 's always better to try and get a local onto your side .
Sometimes they 're really open , and interested in helping strangers to get to where the real fun is .
And as long you find a common language to use with them - even a sign language - they 'll take places not included in the most popular lists , but sure to make your experience a lot more authentic and enjoyable .

"I disagree with the statement for many reasons but I must agree with the fact that a tour guide can provide useful information about certain places that you can visit and that you may not know about .
I , being a very curious person , prefer to be left on my own to explore a certain place and learn about it by myself or at least accompanied by a friend or a family member .

By exploring a tourist atraction by yourself such as an ancient palace or castle , for example , you could wind up discovering several curious nooks or rooms not offered in a normal touring schedule .
If I 'm exploring a castle without the guidance of a tour guide , I might want to carry some sort of map or written information about the place so I can not only satiate my curiosity but also learn interesting facts in the process .

A teacher of mine once told me an experience she had when she visited some turkish palace some time ago .
She did not enjoy following the crowd of tourists around so she lagged behind of the tour group .
As they found themselves in some room , she struck up a conversation with one of the gaurds .
The gaurd liked her and told her that he could show her one of the rooms the `` regulars '' did n't have any access to .
The gaurd took my teacher through a door into one of the most gorgeous gold-laminated , ruby-studded room she had ever seen .

Tour guides can often be boring an monotonous and herd people along through different places as if they were a flock of sheep .
They will give the usual tour to the usual type tourists , one after another , after another , after another .
There is no dynamism involved in a guided tour , no interaction between the people , the guide and the location .
It 's the same routine for the tour guide : look here , take a picture there , here X person died , room after room .

By exploring a place on your own with a propper , written , guide you can learn a lot more and also enjoy some degree of independence .
If I ever visit the chateaus of France or the pagodas in Japan , I would largely prefer to be left on my own to inspect and explore every hidden room , corner and passageway .

"Alone , the Best Way to travel it

I disagree with the statament that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I consider that it is better to travel alone .

I believe that when people travel in groups , they have to be accountable to the group .
This can be very stressful and could affect the way they enjoy their vacations or trip .
For instanse , if anything happen to any person of the group , the other people have to wait or spend time assisting this person .
In the contrary , I believe that when we travel alone we are able to develop our own schedule and to enjoy more freely without any interferance from any other person .
This will have a possitive impact in our vacation or trip that it was ultimately taken in order to relax and enjoy as much as possible .
Also , we will spend the time in the best manner without wasting time .

Moreover , when we travel in a group with a tour guide , we are not able to decide our trip 's plan , but we have to relay on the guide for any step to take during the trip .
In the oppositive , if we travel alone we know that we can make any decision regarding our trip 's plan or to decide the lenght of our stay or visit depending on our own circunstances , which defenitevely is more suitable and appropriate for me .
The goal is to enjoy the trip .

Also , travelling alone seems to be less expensive that travelling with a tour guide .
The fact that we have to hire a guide will increase the cost of the trip .

Furthermore , I believe that if travel alone , we will have more time to see the thing that really interest us .
For instance , in my own expenriece , when I visit a museum i like to spend enough time looking at the pictures rather than the other things .
If i have to follow a tour guide during a trip , it could happen that he or she will show the group the things that he or she considers important for her/his own , but it could be less important for me .
This could be dissapointed in the case that you cannot move forward to really enjoy or see what you really want to do .

Moreover , if you want to take any break during the trip , you will allow to do so if you are alone without asking anybody for permission .
We know if we travel with a tour guide in a group , you have to fully cooperate with everybody , and if you take a break will affect the group and their schedule .

In conclusion the best way to travel is alone , without a group or guide to follow as per all the above mentioned reasons .

"There are different ways of traveling , and they are all determined by the traveler 's specific interests .
In my experience , the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide limits the options of the traveler forcing him to follow a pre-set itinerary of activities , some of his interest and some he probably wo n't enjoy .
Traveling in a large group , will imply not only to follow the itinerary but the pace of the group .

The idea of traveling should be to experience as much of the new place , people and their culture as possible .
Furthermore , it should provide personal enjoyment to who is travelling .

In our everyday life we have to comply with schedules and rules , when we are on vacation we should take advantage of this unique opportunity of having complete control and determine by ourselves how we want to spend our time .
By doing this we will release stress and tension , feel challenged and invigorated with the adventure that leaving our daily routine and comfort zone represent .

There should n't be limitations , the advancement of communications , technology and the availability of information make simple to create a tailored trip for any taste , with the freedom of adjusting it as we go .

It is important to involve people from the area when possible , specially when traveling to a foreign country where we are not used to the language and more importantly to theculture .
It is also recommendable to research and prepare a tentative list of activities prior to the trip to avoid spending valuable time once we are abroad .

A small group of friends and your own itinerary should be the best way to travel , by doing this we will enjoy a new experience with people that share similar interest and at the same time will break our daily routines by being completely free to choose exactly what we want to do .

"I strongly agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group with a person that can guide you in the place where you are going .
I believe that this is important in order to know a place because I usually like to visit places with a good historical background .
If I want to take advantage of the time while I am travelling , and this time is limited , I do not want to waste it , just trying to recognize what places are important in that city or location .
For instance , if I go to Italy , I would love to go to all the museums , and famous restaurants .
I also would enjoy the opportunity to go to the beaches in the mediterranean sea .
Normally , a tourist would need more than a month just to plan these activities .
However , if you go with a tour guide , this person will make your life a lot of easier , because he or she already knows where to go , at what time , what are the important parts where a tourist should focus his attention .
Last year , my family went to Dominican Republic .
We bought a all inclusive plan , but we did not have a guide .
We were totally lost there , we did not know where to go .
All the time people were taking advantage of us charging an incredible high amount of money for different services like taxi transportation , only because we do not have anybody that could give us advice or information about the usual fare for that kind of service .
We had to pay $ 20 for buying a sunprotector .
The most expensive sunprotector in my whole life .
Also , sharing your vacations with a group of friends is really wonderful .
I would say that it could n't get better if you are travelling with the people you like and with somebody that already have a plan for you .

"There are a lot of ways to travel and a lot of places to visit , with the development of the transportation means , distances have been reduced considerably , and it is much easier to travel all around the world in an easier , cheaper and faster way .
Maybe when traveling to another place you could wonder what is best to travel in a group lead by a tour guide or to travel by your self ?
I think in order to answer this question you have to take into consideration several factors as where you want to go and how much you are willing to spend , among other things .

I think it is really important to choose a destination because there are some places where a guide would be necessary , as a colonial city or a city filled whith history and monuments to visit , but if you are going to a beach or a place just to relax , you may not need a guide to show you the city .

The amount of money you are willing to spend on your jounrey can also determine whether you hire a guide or not , if you are traveling on an austere way , it would be better if you did not hire a guide , but if you had a lot of money to spend and you want to visit every inch of the city it would be a great idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

For what is written above it can be seen thet , there are some things that have to be considered when deciding if traveling on a group with a guide or traveling by yourself , but there are also some other factors , as the saftey of the place you are visiting , as well as the knowledge of the language and the culture you are going to visit that can make you decide what is better to travel by yourself or to travel as a group on a guided visit .

"In my life I have visited a variaty of nations .
I have come to comprehend the complexity of some cultures as well as the unique characteristics each nation provides .
Each cultural enviroment provides a characteristic to mandkind 's identity .
The language , the food and the history every nation in the world provides is be experienced when one travels to that nation .
Once we are surrounded by that culture we can explore it in a variaty of ways .
Two ways are by ourselfs and by guidence of a tourguide .
What I have come to realize is that a trip becomes more gratifying , as well as at the same time it provides a greater cultural aspcet of the nation , when does it with a tour guide .

Although the first argument against my opioin is that with a guide we are attained to his shcedule this comes to play a small part in the desire turist have to adquire knowledge from a foreing nation .
It might be true that with a group and a guide we are enshrouded in a surrounding where desicions are made by the majority .
What comes to be more relevant is that although as an individual in a grup we are unable to decide where to go as an individual we do not know where to go .

In order to adquire a diverse aspect of the culture we visit we must learn what characterizes the culture .
A tour guide is more than able to explain where the culture of the nation stands out for its unique characteristics .
A tour guide provides as well what I personally seek in a trip , knowdlege about the nations history .
By ourselfs we are able to visit far more scenarios but at the same time we are unable to grasp the meaning behind each scenario .
In a trip I preffer to see few scenarios but once I come home I return with a load of cultural background conserning each scenario i visited .
The pleasure each experience grants me is greater when I know the social , political , economic and historic background that the experience withholds .

Some do not like the pressure a group imposes .
I rather think of the shcedule in a group as the best way to handle my time in a trip .
With a shcedule I regulate the time it takes me to visit each place in the culture I seek to explore .
I preffer to know what I should learn from rather than wander around the city I visit .
As an individual I would get of track my trip when I start to think of what I must do in order to get the most gratification out of my time in that nation .

A guide provides information , a schedule and when we combine these two aspects a guide comes to provide a vast cultural knowldge I desire to discover .
What a trip evokes in my mind is an unsaciable thrist of knowledge .
This thrist would unlikely be calm down by my own .
It is best if I have someone that is able to give me the background information of the mation I visit .
By visitng a nation with a guide and a group I also learn from a new perspective .
What to me might be intresting to some member of my group that same object stands out as dull .
A guide and a group come to provide experiences , poins of view , cultural knowledge that when put together create a cultural diversity which comes to transalte into a remarkable trip .

"This statement is true and false .
First of all , when there is a lot of people traveling toguether it may be better to travel with a tour guide , because is difficult for many pepple traveling toguether to maintain an order , and they can get lost , or they may disagree of certain places to go .
Traveling with a group can result in many problems and a lot of difficulties during the travel , so the best way to manage that is by having a tour guide .

I think in my personal opinion that the best way is to travel alone .
The person traveling alone can collect information from internet , magazines or books , and go to that strange country by her | himself , and do the best he | she can to visit the best and most wonderfull places in that country and experience for her | himself .

Its true that the tour guide is more experienced in visiting the place you dont know , but people learn better when they have to figure out things by themselfs .
For example , when you go to a museum , before you go , if you are alone , you need to investigate about it , and learn about it and things of that nature , so you can confirm that this museum is a good place for you to visit .
In the contrary , when someone is in a group led by a tour guide , there are a lot of distractions , because of the quantity of people in the group , and is more difficult to pay attention or to look at pictures for example in a museum , when there is a lot of people following a tour guide .

Another important thing is that when you are in a group led by a tour guide , you have to follow that group where they go , instead of going where you wish to go , and where your feelings take you .
For me being in a vacation is doing whatever you want and whenever you want to do it , so being with a tour guide is like being in a school trip , and you cant do what you wish to do .

Tour guides are perfect for school trips or things of that nature , because kids need to follow someone .

"There are many ways to travel around the world , by group , individually , in a family , with a tour guide , friends or even by yourself .
First , traveling in a group might be good if you know the people you are traveling with .
A tour guide might be good if you are to lazy to learn and adventure yourself .
If you travel you have to be open minded to face new experinces .
Traveling to another country or a new place is not going to be exciting unless it becomes challenging and fun .
The only way to step on those emotions is guiding yourself , otherwise if you are gonna take a tour guide better stay home and buy a book of the place you desire to go , as well traveling in a group is more a waste of time .

Secondly , a tour guide will only show you what he things is important , or whatever he believes that is interesting from his point of view .
Therefore , if you want to really learn of the place you must do it by yourself and probably with a partner to have a safe trip .
In fact , as a tourist you migth miss some important details of the place , but as well from everysingle place is visited you will be more likely to be able to depicted to others because you had to figure out everything by yourself .
Unforgettable experiences are those experinces where our mind was working in its maximum .

In addition , traveling in a group is not the best idea because usually they travel in lower pace nad because of the quantity of people together is not comfortable to go to small places , where it is already overcrowded .
Traveling individually gives you more flexibility in your schedule .
Time is gold and what you with in during your travel is very important .
For example if you go to Louvre in a group you might have to wait 8 hrs .
to get in .
Instead if you figure out that late night you only have to wait 20 min. you are more likely to go around Paris and enjoy your day and then go to the Louvre , other than stick to the group and waste your time .

In conclusion , traveling alone is more fun and useful than in a group with a tour guide .
Life is about learning and taking adventures .
You want to live , so travel and have fun , but if you do n't better buy a book and stay home or waste your time traveling in a group with a useless tour guide .

"Traveling is an experience that is extremly related with every individual 's personality , style of life , and interests .
That is why people travel in very different ways and there is always a market for every type of traveler .
For me traveling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the worst and most unconfortable ways of traveling since I am an adventurer and in those kinds of trips it is difficult to get so much flexibility as I like .
Traveling for me is one of the best ways to form our own personality and to have experiences that will shape our life for ever .
When you have a tour gide , the possibilities of achieving those experiences will be drastically limited because you will always be lead by another person 's point of view .

Visiting museums , ruins , antique buildings and all of the rich historical places for me is what makes the difference on a trip but being led by a tour guide on all of them is not the kind of experience I would like .
It is important to have a guide while visiting historical places because you learn things that by yourself you would never have discovered but , the problem is when the guide is the same person in all of them like in most tour guided trips .

When groups travel with one guide they recive the point of view of only one person everywhere they go .
I believe that history is is closely related with facts but those facts are always related with the historian 's point of view , tour guides as every person who knows about history imply their opinion on their explenations and by listening only to one person will limitate us to create our own judgement .

Flexibility is also very important for me when traveling .
I am a kind of person who likes to decide every detail of the trip and by having a tour guide you are not able to do those kinds of desicions .
Also I belive that doing several things with out planing are always fun because the experience will be always different .
This way we meet different people , we live things that we thought we never would and finally I could say that we are able to enjoy things that we thought were not going to happen .

Traveling , meeting new people , living new experiences , has made me the person I am now .
I do not like to be led by someone else .
I think that defending my personal opinion is the most important thing I can do .
Traveling with a tour guide may be the best way for traveling for many people but for me traveling is so personal that it has to be an experience compleatly of your own .

"If one intends to be a tourist , it is logical to form part of a group and hire a tour guide .
However , if one wants to be a traveler , a path that I have always chosen when visiting countries , one must be independent .
One must fully experience the culture of a country , go beyond tour guides and give oneself space to explore and savor the aspects of one 's interest .
Groups and tour guides only confine the experience and more often than not leave the tourist disappointed .

A group limits one 's options .
For example , if a person is interested in art more than in shopping , he or she might have to be satisfied with the time given to explore an art museum in a group 's schedule .
On the other hand , if one is not part of a group , one can spend whatever time one wants in an art museum , avoiding what would probably otherwise be a somewhat superficial experience .
A group also often has a budget .
If a person is highly interestd in the gastronomic aspect of a culture , he or she might be willing to spend more money on food quality and variety .
Nevertheless , a group does not provide this flexibility .

Getting a tour guide is often a recipe for disillusionment .
Tour guides have a schedule , and are probably not willing to linger on any specific monument or work of art .
More importantly , it is difficult to truly appreciate a culture without reading or investigating about the country being visited .
Being confident a tour guide will provide all the information may lead travelers to neglect research prior to visiting , often as the result of an overestimation of the tour guide 's knowledge and passion for his or her job .
Lastly , tour guides often lead visitors to the infamous `` tourist traps '' : locations , stores or restaurants often exalted by guides and books that are not worth so much praise in reality .
Without a tour guide , one can avoid such scams and disappointments by doing independent study and choosing which places to visit .

While travelling in a group led by a tour guide is often convenient and less expensive than planning the adventure alone , it takes away value from the actual trip .
I , for one , greatly value independence and enthusiasm when going to a foreign country .
Thus , my option is always counting my family as my group and being my own tour guide .

If I had to do a fast tour through several cities in a short time , I would prefer to have a guide , so he or she could show me the most significative places to be seen in each city and I would not feel I missed the most important things .
Other good thing about guides is that they usually are very familiar to the place and its history , they know the little details , shops , stories , costumes and typical food every visitor has to try at least once to get to say they actually been there .
Maybe there wo n't be much time left to wander around looking at the arquitecture or the landscape furthermore than what the guide has already scheduled , besides there is always a great number of persons within the same group of tourists , taking pictures and asking questions all the time , so the tour can turn into a stressing race against time .

I would really prefer to travel on my own with plenty on time , but who would n't ?
Unfortunately that is not always possible .
It is always nicer to walk looking around at the same time , steping by little shops and cafes , talking to people , asking for directions , going to the places you choose to go to and discovering everything on your own .
I think that is the travel ideal for many of us , but we usually have a hard time on finding the time to do it that way , and instead make plans with too many destinations all at once in a small schedule .

Furthermore, facts provide credibility and accuracy to our understanding of the world. In academic research, facts are the evidence that supports arguments and conclusions. Without factual evidence, ideas and concepts become merely speculative and lack substance.

Moreover, facts are crucial for making informed decisions. Whether in politics, health, or economics, having a solid grasp of factual information is essential for making sound judgments and choices.

In conclusion, while understanding ideas and concepts is important, facts serve as the foundation upon which our knowledge is built. Without a firm grasp of facts, our understanding of the world would be incomplete and unreliable. Therefore, learning facts is equally, if not more, important than understanding ideas and concepts.",P7,SPA,high,1
"I strongly agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. While facts provide us with information, it is the understanding of ideas and concepts that allows us to analyze, apply, and synthesize that information effectively.

Understanding ideas and concepts fosters critical thinking skills, enabling individuals to connect information in meaningful ways and draw conclusions. This higher-level thinking is crucial in problem-solving and decision-making, as it allows individuals to think beyond the surface level and consider various perspectives.

Moreover, understanding ideas and concepts promotes a deeper level of learning compared to memorizing facts. When individuals grasp the underlying principles and theories behind a subject, they are better equipped to adapt to new situations and apply their knowledge in different contexts.

For example, in the field of science, knowing the concept of gravity is more valuable than memorizing the formula for calculating gravitational force. Understanding gravity allows scientists to comprehend its effects on objects in the universe and develop new theories and technologies based on this foundational concept.

In conclusion, while facts are important, it is the understanding of ideas and concepts that truly empowers individuals to think critically, solve problems creatively, and apply their knowledge in meaningful ways. Therefore, prioritizing the comprehension of ideas and concepts over rote memorization of facts is essential for fostering a deeper level of learning and intellectual growth.",P7,SPA,high,1
"I agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. While facts provide foundational knowledge, it is the comprehension of ideas and concepts that allows for critical thinking, problem-solving, and application of knowledge in various contexts.

Understanding ideas and concepts enables individuals to make connections between different pieces of information, leading to a deeper level of learning. For example, in the field of science, memorizing facts about chemical elements is important, but understanding the periodic table and the concept of chemical bonding allows one to predict how different elements will interact in chemical reactions.

Moreover, the ability to grasp ideas and concepts fosters creativity and innovation. Instead of simply regurgitating facts, individuals who understand underlying principles can think creatively to come up with new solutions to complex problems.

In conclusion, while facts are essential for building a knowledge base, it is the understanding of ideas and concepts that drives critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. Therefore, prioritizing the comprehension of concepts over mere memorization of facts is crucial for intellectual growth and success in various fields.",P7,SPA,high,1
"I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. While facts are necessary for building a foundation of knowledge, understanding ideas and concepts allows for deeper learning, critical thinking, and application of knowledge in various contexts.

When one grasps ideas and concepts, they can connect different pieces of information, analyze situations, and solve problems creatively. For example, in mathematics, memorizing formulas and equations may help in solving specific problems, but truly understanding the underlying concepts of algebra or geometry enables one to apply those principles to a wide range of mathematical problems.

Furthermore, understanding ideas and concepts promotes lifelong learning and adaptability. In a rapidly changing world, where new information is constantly emerging, the ability to understand and apply concepts is crucial. For instance, in the field of science, knowing the facts about a particular theory is not as valuable as understanding the underlying principles that govern that theory and being able to apply them to new research or discoveries.

In conclusion, while facts are important for acquiring knowledge, understanding ideas and concepts is essential for critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability. By focusing on understanding, individuals can develop a deeper level of knowledge that is more versatile and applicable in various situations.",P7,SPA,high,1
"Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?
I think not .
First , because facts are things that can really be change .
Facts are the way they are and there is nothing we can do about then to change then or to modify the things they try to let us know .

In the other hand , ideas , as the name give us a clue , are the things we think or believe about something .
As an example , we all know that we need air to live .
If there were no air , we all would die .
But instead of only teaching this we get the Ideas of why air is necessary .
We breath it , it goes to our lungs then the oxigen is transported to the whole body traveling by the blood .
We can get to know that it is important .

Following the same example , we can find the concept of `` breathing '' then we get all the idea we mentioned above .
With that information we can reach a fact : Air is needed to live .

Another reason why ideas and concepts are better than only facts .
With the first I mentioned we can find out more information than with facts .
Thanks to the concepts , we can understand the way things are , the way why the sky is blue , why our blood is red , how is it that the light is reflected , etc ..

Facts let us know things someone else , thanks to investigation , concepts and ideas discovered .
Someone may say `` What 's so wrong about it ? ''
If we are not motivated to investigate , to satisfy our necessity of knowing , we will only take the `` free samples '' we recieve from facts .
Besides , if we cook our ideas , and bake our spicy concepts then we can find a complete menu of knowlage .
Free to whoever who wants to try it .
And once you try it , you are going to look for it .
It is better to cook thant just to but a pack of cookies .

To make my point clear , with facts we do n't reall y get to investigate or to make a research about things .
But with ideas and concepts we can create our facts , thanks to the information we looked for .
And that is why I disagree with the statement on the first line .
",P7,SPA,high,0
"I totally agree with the statement because not only I find that memorizing facts is most of the time totally useless , but I strongly believe that there is no use in learning if students cannot apply the acquired information in different ways .

Facts such as dates , names , places , and definitions are recorded in books , encyclopedias , newspapers , and electronic documents .
There is no point in spending time memorizing them , when we can have access to such data if we know how and where to find it .
Rather than having students memorize the meaning of a word , they should be taught how to look it up in a dictionary .
Instead of asking students to memorize facts in a particulary history passage , they should be presented with such information just to help them understand the background in which a historical moment took place .

When students are given the opportunity to transfer the ideas and concepts that are being taught into different situations , particularly when those situations are closely related to the student 's reality , the learning process `` sets in '' .
Show them the relationship between speed , distance , and time on the blackboard , and most of them will not be able to understand it .
But ask them what happens if they are late for their first class , and most of them will answer without any hesitation that they would drive faster .

In my experience as a Computer Science teacher who teaches programming in a local high school , I 'd rather have my students try to figure out how to solve a particular problem by understanding what needs to be done , than letting them worry about the implementation details .
This approach is not easy for them at the beginning : they want to know how all instructions in a particular language are written , and they often feel frustrated when instead of giving them the answer right away , I ask them to check the developer 's documentation .

Once they understand that the language details are not important , because they can always go and check how a particular instruction is written or can be used , they can focus on what is truly important in computer programming : developing the skills that are needed to solve any given problem .

The most rewarding comment I have had in these 12 years as a Computer Science teacher came from a student that is now in College studying a major in Engineering .
I found him this morning here , at the IBT Testing Center , and he said : `` Ms .
Cannon , thank you for teaching me problem-solving .
You ca n't imagine how I still use the strategies that you taught me in your class , even in subjects that do not have anything to do with engineering . ''

"To me both aspects are important because a student should have the knowlege and the understanding of the idea and the concepts of an specific topic before they learn a fact on it .

That is because I actually think that , when you have a fact on any matter , that fact happens as a response to several or various events that happend before therefore an student should know all the concepts and ideas , or all the information he can have on a certain matter to become aware or to have a logical explanation of why that fact or event turned that way .

In my specific field of medicine , that is obstetrics and ginecology , an student needs to know all the information about labor and delivery , for example , refering to all the changes the uterus , the delivery channel and the vagina go thru , and all of the bio-mechanical aspects of the uterus contractions , the biochemicals aspect of the contraction , all the active and passive changes that the mother an the fetus have in the labor and delivery event , as well as all the changes that occur in the pregnancy , before getting to learn how to take care or handle a delivery event .
That way if something goes wrong he will have all the information on wath is going wrong an if there is a way to make it go the way it is supposed to go , and have the knowledge to handle any undesired event .

Tha same reason apllies to a student that can learn how to do a c-section , or learn the tehcnics aspects of how to perfomr it , but if he does not have all the anatomical information about the human body , anything can go wrong in that procedure and it will turn to the death of the mother and the baby .

So I think that every fact has an explanation and the more you learn about the conceps or ideas leading to a certain fact the more you will know about the fact itself .
",P7,SPA,high,0
"I do not agree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''

Facts are points of information which are a hundred percent right , cannot be denied and can be proven right an infinite amount of times .

The law 's of gravity are examples of factual information .
This information can never be proved wrong therefore it is important for a student to learn this rather than information that could be wrong .

Concepts and ideas also have a huge amount of importance regarding the education of a student however it is not as inporntant as factual information .
this ideas are only someones theories and thoughts , they have n't been proved right yet .
When theories or ideas are proven to be right they become facts .

When comparing these two types of information one must look at their origin .
If a fact is a theory or idea that has been proven to be right the inportance of this information is therefore greater than the inportance of the ideas .

Students need to learn about laws or facts in order to really know how to approach and especific research .
Theories are very often rejected and replaced by others , this constant rejection of theories is why theories lose inportance throughout time .

There was a time when the earth was believed to be flat , this was a theory .
When technology gave men the power to actually investigate this theory the idea was rejected and therefore replaced by a fact , that the earth is round .
Correct knowledge is what actually matters in a student 's education .
If the information learned was wrong then there is no purpose on learning that .

Ideas and concepts still play a huge factor because in order to investigate something there must be a theory and someone willing to prove it wrong .
I no one figured that the earth was flat it is likely that none would have tried to actually find out .

Therefore the inportance of each kind of information can vary and often depends on the students beliefs and goals .
If the student is more interested in scientific reserch then both kinds of informantion must be equally evaluated .
But if the students is in to less scientific or objective activities like art and music concepts and ideas play a bigger role .

"I fully agree with the statement saying that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I will base my essay on my personal experience in order to consolidate my position .

As a child , one 's normally forced to learn all the concepts by heart .
This applies to when we learned things such as letters , numbers and colors .
However , this system only works while people are really young because when they grow up , the scenario changes dramatically .

When I began my first Physics course , I was used to learn everything that was written on a paper or a text book .
The problem appeared when I had to solve an exercise asking me to calculate the impact that gravity had on athletes .
I was unable to solve the problem with all the formulas and theories that I had learned the night before .
I was completly blocked .

I realised then , that understanding the ideas could be much better for me than just learning facts .
I forced myself to get the idea from the sources I had and share the information found with my colleagues and teachers .
This ritual or studying method allowed me to have a better picture of the problem and find a better way to solve it .

Since then , I started forgeting about the traditional way of studying but beginning to understand where the main idea was coming from .
This way of learning is now helping me to solve the problems that I normally face when I 'm working .

When my manager asks me to answer one of his questions , he is not waiting for me to repeat everything that I 've learned from the school but for a quick response and solution .
If you do n't know what the main ideas are , you will not be able to interact with other professionals .

Once again , my own experience makes me confirm what I stated at the beginning .
Teachers and professors should take this new way of studying in order to teach their students accordingly .
Whatever they teach today could help their students in a future .

"Is a fact more important than to understand ideas and concepts ?
The answer to this question is not easy at all .
For some , a student is better educated if he knows a great number of facts .
For others it is better to know the ideas and concepts , for this knowledge allows you to create your own facts .
This essay will analyze that ideas and concepts are more important than facts alone .

Facts , are information that allows a person to solve a situation or problem .
They are answers to questions .
For example , we know now that environmental warming today is causing the North pole to melt , that 's a fact .
But how did we get to that fact ?
That 's why facts alone should not be the most important educational element for students .
In order to create our own facts or understand how information has been created we need to understand ideas and concepts .

In connection to the above , ideas an concepts are important for they let us acquire knowledge of facts by ourselves .
For example , if a student gets trained in advanced math , he will possibly be able to create his own math theories .
In other words he will be able to create or explain facts .
This evidently conforms a better education for a student .

In conclusion , ideas and concepts are more important and have more educational value .
A student that knows facts will not have the abilities of one that understands ideas and concepts .
In this sense my personal opinion has been proved .
It is better knowing how to create facts than getting the answers from a book .

"I firmly agree with the opinion that it is more important for students to learn how to understand ideas and concepts than just learn facts and data .
It may be true that facts are basic for a successful academic career , however for all the rest of the human beings it is just personal enrichment .
It may also be true that learning raw data is a very rewarding experience , but again I would suggest to focus this desire on more stimulating and challenging activities .

First , facts are much easier to forget than ideas .
I am sure that no friend of mine from school will remember all the names of the rivers in our country , but they maybe can remember why the PC has been so important in the development of our culture .
Therefore , it is much more useful to learn something that you will not forget than just have a hard time with nonsense tough data , which you have to read over and over because it does n't have any logic behind !

Second , in our work we hardly use specific facts .
But we certainly use ideas , concepts , arguments and logical discussions .
At least I do in my consulting job .
I have learned to structure my thoughts and put into practice improvement levers simply by understanding and applying ideas , not by remembering facts .

Third , facts can be looked again and again in books whenever we want .
Nowadays , there is no problem in finding information .
We can just connect to the Internet , make a search and find it right there .
When I do n't remember a formula , I just do that .
Google is my good friend when I have memory loss .
Maybe other people just have a neighbour that knows it all or a teacher who is an expert in that field .
I could go on saying that what the world lacks are good ideas , revolutionary thoughts that can improve the society we live in .

This last idea leads me to my final argument : facts are part of the past while ideas are the raw material of the future .
The formula of a circle has been invented many years ago , but how we will beat cancer is a pending subject and only with good ideas we will suceed in this matter .
We should be engaged in providing an outstanding ideas-focused education to the future Einsteins .
For instance , during my education in high school in the USA I experienced a quite different approach compared to the European one .
We should foster this type of education .

Summing up , my opinion is that students should learn what will be useful for them and for the society as a whole .
Consequently , managing concepts and with their interaction reaching conclusion is much more productive than memorizing loads of books .
",P7,SPA,high,0
"Personally , I would agree with this statement , and the raesons are fairly simple .
Facts alone cannot help you much , a better understanding of concepts will help in the developing of new ideas , and if we only focus on facts , we will miss the big picture .

Facts alone cannot help anyone alone .
An ideal example would be a detective tryiong to solve a crime .
Let 's say the detective have all the facts he got all the information or evidence he needs , but he still needs to understand these facts and evidence .
He will needs a reason for the crime , an understanding of human feelings and reactions to certain situation because without a good understanding these all the evidence and information are worthless .

A complete understanding of the concepts will help us create new ideas .
For example .
imagine a scientist trying to come with anew theory of the atom .
These scientist needs to understand all of the concepts and reasonig that involve the atom because if we do not understand the past how can we create a better future .

It is said that t make an objectical abservations we should trow all of our emmotions away , and only focus on the facts .
That might be true for machines or any kind of object because they do not posses emmotions .
However , when we are making observations about an person or anything that have emotions this would only cause problem .
Imagine that aperson id being trial for fighting with another man for no apparent reason .
This man should suffer some kind of punishment for doing this .
However , let 's say this man 's wife had a car accident the afternoon of the day of the fight , and now she is in a critical state fighting for her life .
The man who had never had any kind of trouble breaks apart and decides to go for a drink , but he gets drunk and starts punching the man sittin beside him .
Should this man be punish for doing this ? .
H is a critical moment his wife might die .

"An education system should be capable of giving to the students all the elements in order to be a better persons and professionals .
Obviusly , understanding ideas and concepts is very important for the students for learnig and analize things , but I think that is not enough .

Students should have all the elements in order to resolve problems and face conflicts in the future .
Learning specifics facts , like history facts or gramar facts , is important , but is not the only way to get a complete education .
The specific facts , students learn them for the exam and forget next day , but if the teachers teach them how to connect ideas , how to understand concepts , how to make a connection between this with that , students will have the elements to be a sucesfull people .

An student can know everything about history or maths or maybe chemistry , buy if he ca n't make a logical conexion between facts and ideas , it does n't make any sense .
When students have to face on working expirience , they wo n't need specifical facts that they learn in school , they will need the capacity of conecting ideas and understanding concepts .
The last sentence does n't mean that facts , as dates or formulas or specifics things , students does n't need them in working life , probably will probably wo n't , but I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more valuable for a company when they want a good employer .

"I believe learning ideas and concepts is far more rewarding for students than only learning a bunch of meaningless facts .
Specially as the student start to progress in his knowledge , ideas and concepts should become more and more relevant than facts alone .

Even though the normal process to reach a concept or idea requires us to learn facts before understanding them , it is clearly of higher importance to understand the concept as whole .
In fact , understanding the concepts is the only way to apply all the facts we learn .

For instance , in my working experience I have noticed how two different persons aproach problems .
The first one tries to memorize the solutions and does not care about the underling reasons of the problem .
The second one reaserches the facts for the superior task of understanding the problem as a whole .
Clearly the second one always comes with new and suported ideas on how to resolve the situation , however , the first one is always talking about specific information that does not help the solution at all .

Another example of the higher importance understanding ideas have over learning facts is the following .
When there is a complete understanding of the concept you can apply the same concept to a similar situation regardless of the different facts you may encounter .
Addittionally , the sum of ideas and concept can even form a more complete and complex reasoning for a wide variety of situations .
On the contrary , the sum of facts would not lead us to the same aplication regarding diferent situations .

The fact that ideas and concepts are of higher value is the only fact students should have on their minds as they progress in their knowledge .
I definatly believe it is more important for studentes to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

"I disagree that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than it is to learn facts .
With this a do not mean that understanding ideas and concepts are useless , of course you need them for everything you do , like in your personal life , in your work , etc .
The point that I think that is more important learning the facts it is because you are actually living in real life the problem .
Understanding ideas may give the basis for the problem but many times when you are in the real situation it is not like they taught us it would be .
Like for an example when you are studying in the college , they teach how the companies work , they give you all the ideas and concepts of what you are suppose to do in such situation , and many tools to resolve many problems in your professional life .
But this is no even close of what actually happens in real life .
When you graduate and finish school and a company hires you , this a different story .
The problems are much bigger and stressing than the ones you study .
For resolving this problems you have to implement all the knowledge you have study .

The facts gives you a wider vision of what is happening around the world .
I think that studying facts gives you the knowledge and the experience to face the problems in you professional life .
Experience is one of the most importante attributes that a persona can have when you are looking for a job .
This will help you to resolve the problems in a way a lot easier than your collegues and it could be a value that you your superiors would evaluate like a principle asset .

"The statement , `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' , is a controversial one , but personally I agree with it .
Thera are many reasons for my to believe that ideas and concepts are more important when students are in a learning process .

Firstly , when understanding and idea , you should support it with a wide range of examples , but all the facts that could be mentioned are never more worth than the idea itself , just because is the idea the main source for all the facts .
Consequently I understand that the comprenhension of the ideas is the key for all the facts .

On the other hand , I really belive that concepts , even though when they are drawn through empiric examples and high complicated laboratory experiments , will be always concepts .
As a matter of fact , those concepts will be ready to be applicated on any new fact .
So even though we learn from facts and experiences to get empiric conclusions and therefore new concepts , I have observed during my life that concepts will remain over any fact .

Besides the arguments listed above , I also support the rule of being up to date on learning ideas and concepts because understanding the causes you will always ready to discover new facts and the insight reasoning of them .
Otherwise we could get lost in a pool of numbers and figures without knowing how to solve many questions and challenges and turning an easy situaition in a difficult problem , just because the lack of ideas and concepts to overcome it .

In conclusion , I close recomend to all students to enhance their abilities to understand the core ideas and concepts on whatever the might be interested on , and to get the skills for future successful career development .

"Over the years , people have developed two very important theories about a student 's development .
Some will say that it is more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts and others will say that it is more important for them to learn facts .

Personally , I believe that both theories are important , but the understanding of ideas and concepts is the real key to a student 's success .
I say this because if a student just learns facts , that is all that they are learning , simple facts .
On the other hand , if a student learns to understand concepts and ideas , he or she is getting the tools to face all types of situations in school , university , job , and life itself .

A clear example of what I mention above are two friends that I grew up with , but graduated from different schools .
One of them graduated from a school where their principal objective was to teach the student how to think , analyze and understand concepts and ideas besides just teaching them facts and the other one came from a school where the main teaching technique was to make students memorize all types of information .
When the time to go to the university came , both students graduated from school with excellent grades but the difference among them started to show on the way .
The one that was used to learning and memorizing facts started to experience serious difficulties if things did n't work out exactly as they were supposed to , while the one trained to understand concepts and ideas found out how to work his way through the changes and experienced much better results .
Over the years , the student who was just taught facts saw the results that the other one was obataining and finally comprehended that he needed to change .
Once he did , things started working out much better for him .

I am sure that the example I mention above happens all the time all over the world .
Personally , I was lucky enough to be taught to understand concepts and ideas rather than just plain facts and I can assure that it has helped me a lot throughout my life because it has given me the tools to comprehend , understand and analyze things from different points of view , from different perspectives and to look for solutions when apparently ther are n't any , which you wo n't be able to do if you just learn facts .

"As an undergraduate student I know the importance of understanding ideas and concepts more than facts .
Why ?
Well because I believe that the idea has the important information .
Sometimes it is not necessary to know specific things about a theme , it is more important to understand the central idea , so that the facts can be used as reference .
For example , if a topic is a difficult one , it can be easier for someone to understand the idea first , so that later he or she can analyze the fact , solve problems using the fact , or investigate other facts .

I think that if someone undestands the central idea and if that person is able to explain it to someone else , in a way that he can understand it too , it means that he has already learned the important thing .
I am sure that to explain the idea he will use the fact he analized before , so he has already relationed the fact and the idea .

If the person remembers the facts .
I am not sure , but I believe that most people cannot accept a fact unless they understand why is that .
It is not easy to tell somebody that something is going to happen in a certain way if something else .
As a good example we have kids , they are always asking why is this , or that , and they do not stop asking until they understand the answer , and as they grow up they learn that facts have an explanation .

I know that there are some facts that someone has to know , some basic things people has to understand , like the meaning of a green light , because this is a sign that means the same in the whole world , but facts like this are few , that is why I think that it is more important to understand the idea o concept .
",P7,SPA,high,0
"I would have to say it is more important to understand ideas , I will explain to you why .

First of all we have the memory problem .
Most of the schools around the world and also most of the universities want their students to learn facts and concepts , and every student is capable of doing so in an affective way , however this is just temporary knowledge , those concepts and facts will be erased from their brains probably right after the test , if not , they wil be there for jsut a little longer but not enought .

On the other hand , when a student understands the ideas he does not have to memorice anything , because he uses he logic to infer things .
That is the kind of knowledge that will remain with him for a longer amount of time .

Second , we have the learning and applying factor .
When a student memorice or learn facts , is perfectly able to approve the tests and gradute , but when this student turns into a proffesional , a doctor for example , if the only thing he did in college was learning by heart avery little concept and fact , when he gets to the real life as a proffesional , he wo n't be able to give a diagnosis as good as someone that actually understood instead of learn .
why ?
because not every case , and every problem ( not just in medicine but in any other major ) is exactly the same as the one before , and most of them are not exactly the same as the ones we saw on the text book or the ones we learned by heart .
So the student , now proffesional , that undestood the material will not tight himself to the definition he learned but he will take into account all possible explanations while the one that just memoriced will see the problem within a fence .

Finally , it is cientifically proved that understand concepts helps the knowledge to prevail with time .
I 'm not saying memoricing is bad , I 'm just saying that it should n't be the only thing to take into account when you are training a future professional , because at the end , the most important thing is not the knowledge you have or how many text books you learned by heart when you were in college , but the way you use all that knowledge .

"Learning and understanding are two cognitive abilities that are closely related and are part of the every day experience of a human being .

I would say that , since students are constantly interacting with their environment and with others , learning from these experiences come as the main factor .
This ability could be defined as the disposition of the student to process information he receives from his environment , through his senses ( what he sees , listens and feels ) and is capable to categorize and keep this information for adaptional purposes .
Each information is contained in what we commonly call : experiences .

And by experiences I mean facts .
Facts are part of reality , part of the outside world , and helps a student understand a world that should be articulated with his internal experiences ( such as thoughts , and emotions ) .
Moreover , become socially adaptive and in coherence with his own thoughts about how the world works and how will he explain to himself the actions and reactions of his enviroment ; including natural scenarios , people and the diversity of this interactions , which are all part of the process of learning .

Understanding becomes an ability where the student considers what of all that he has learned is comprehensible enough for him .
That is , if he distinguishes significantlly between events and parts of reality .

For example , a new subject ( chemistry , to mention one ) is being taught to a student , first he receives all the information about it , theories , authors , investigations , etc ; but right after he has , lets say , accumulate all this information in his mind , after he has learned about this new subject , he will begin to comprehend , understand it , by re-reading books , articles , by talking and expressing his ideas , by reproducing the author 's point of view , etc .

Therefore , I do n't agree with the statement .
I consider that facing the oustide world is first and it is a process of learning ; understanding is that second part of the process on where the student ( or human being ) will form in his mind ideas , concepts , opinions , even hypothesis about what he has already learned .
So learning and understanding are in the same level of importance .

It is a matter of what comes first and how they influence the interaction between the student 's innerworld and reality placed outside .

"STUDENTS SHOULD RELY IN FACTS
AND NOT CONCEPTS

After I graduated from high school , my physics teacher taught me all kind of concepts for algorythms and formulas .
Later , at the university , when i was doing my internship , I look back and asked myself .
Why I did not learned more didactic and practical things ?
Facts are the best teacher that a person could have in his life .
Concepts are good for the basic teaching but it is not useful in the real life .

Actions demostrate ten times more than a single concept .
A good idea is the one that it is made a reality .
For example , let 's imagine that I am an engineer and I only know the concept to operate a machine .
Can you imagine ?
What am I going to do when I will be in front of my boss and tell him , `` I only know the concepts . ''
It is ridiculous , to learn something without a logical meaning .

Facts are the physical prove of a hypothesis or a project. a student can not learn just an idea , they need to know how to develop the concept .
In particular When I was working in a manufacturing industry , we had to give our client his product .
We could not just tell him that we had the idea of what to do but not how to do it .
Thus , it is important to be awarness of what a student is learning becuase if he does not , it is only an a waste of time .

A student has to consider the facts instead of the ideas becuase it is the only way for the student to understand the purpose of a lesson .
In particular , I enjoy taking classes at SECAP because they give a few theorical classes and the rest is useful practice which will help me in my career .

It is clear , then that the ideas are just a vague imaginary actions that should be put into action .
Hence , students and myself have to rely on the facts of every lesson , for those are the ones that really matter in our life and society .
Between an idea and action , there is a process to work on .

"In any kind of educative , teaching , or learning institution , there are many ways in which classes ( specifically academic ) are imparted .
Many teachers like their students to understand the ideas and concepts they are learning , and other teachers like them to learn about the same things by teaching facts about it .
According to both of this ideas of learning , is it better to undersand ideas and concepts of certain topic ?
Or is it better to learn the facts about the same topic ?

I think that it is very important to learn facts about any topic you want to learn about .
Learning facts is something that will help you in the future because they are very useful .
For example , learning the facts about certain Roman leader who lost the empire will help you in the future , if you are a leader of any kind of institution , to avoid commiting the same mistakes as he did .
Another important thing about facts is that they can never be changed and that most of them are important to know about in order to understand people who are `` experts '' in the career you are applying to .
In that way , you would understand what they 're talking about if they mention any of these facts .
Finally , facts are important because they full-fill your general knowledge on many aspects ( as they say : knowledge is power ) .

In my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts about any topic is something very important in life .
Understanding ideas and concepts about anything will help you to apply these same ideas and topics in the future and make things right , thus becoming a practical person .
When you understand a concept or an idea , you do n't need to learn anymore about it because then you can use it or apply in any way you want , especially in a job or a career .
When you understand a concept , you can even explain it in many ways or in your own words ( it 's better than memorizing things ) .
If you understand an idea , then you can apply the knowledge you have about it and turn it into something practical .
For example , if you study to be a mechanical engineer , and you understand the whole concept of car motors , then you can be able to use this concept to fix motors , or to explain or teach others about motors in a simpler way than how you learned it , so that they can apply the concept in a practical way .
In this example , if you keep doing this or applying your concepts on motors , you can even become the owner of an important car company or an important workshop .

After these explanations and showing my reasoning , I think I agree with the statement that says `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
This probably sounds too rude , buy I really think it is better to be a practical person than just being a `` smartass '' , and you can achieve this by understanding ideas and concepts as a student to apply them afterwards in real life .
And who knows , maybe if you do this , in the future these ideas or concepts may help in your career or in any day life event .
This is why I completely agree with the statement expressed before .

"First , I must say I completely agree with the statment .
It is quite relevant in the education of a country , and about it and its consequences a huge controversia has been opened at the spannish University .

I think everyone accepts that understanding the concept and far more important , being able to get to the facts by yourself using that concept you 've learned at class , is what University should use for .
In other words , they should teach you how to use your capabilities .
In the professional area , what you will need to do is apply what you have learned into completely different cases .
You will never find the sames specifications of the problem you got when you were studying .
You could pass your exam , but you wo n't be prepared for the real world , you will feel completely naked when you 'll find your first problem .

In my case , that I 'm an engineer , it is completely useless to know how to resolve a specific problem .
What I need to know is how to face it , what steps I should take and then work throught it to get it done .
Each time I 'll need a different technique to resolve it , but I should always take the same steps , analyze , decide best options between a brunch of possibilities and finally use it .

Then , what is the problem ?
Why do n't teachers work that way ?
Basically because it is much more complicated to teach concepts and actitudes that facts .
The fact is written and it does n't change .
They just need to read their ` magic ' teacher 's book and copy it .
Someone else did the investigation before .
Instead , to teach concepts , first you have to understand it properly , investigate , you need to get involved in the classroom .
All this means complete dedication and a huge preparation .
and what is more important , I think you need to love what you are teaching .
Another aspect I think a lot of teachers are just there because they did n't have the opportunity to develop their career in their real area .

"Learning is based on too main tecniques , understanding the ideas and concepts and learning facts .
Understanding the ideas and concepts is a very important step in the learning process , it helps students absorbe the essence of the topic .
For example : Jenny has to study science , the first thing she should do is read all the information , digest it and make her oun conclusions based on her knowledge .
Tis step is more general , it includes more aspects than the next one .

After getting the main points of a lesson , students learn the facts .
this provides them with a solid base when the use of the previos knowledge is requied .
In contrast with understandind the ideas , learning facts is a specific activity , where you memorize selected aspects of your interest .

In my opinion understanding the ideas and concepts is as important as learning the facts .
I have been in contact with both of the ways of studiyng and I have got better grades when I learn the facts than when I focuse on understanding the lesson .
Even though when I learn the facts I usually dont get the esence of the lesson , I get better grades .
It is a little absurd but almost all of my classmates had the same problem .
That is why I state in my personal opinion that the understanding is as important as memorizing .
It is a way of itegrating two proceses that complete each other and forming a whole , joining both steps .
As a result the flaws of one would be covered by the good thing of the other and viceversa .

For me , the perfect learning process would be the one which includes both of the steps mentioned above , linking them by relating the overview of a lesson with the specific facts that support it .

"Education goals have changed in the past few years .
People have become aware that school represents a whole world where kids are exposed to a great variety of situations .
From daily tasks like reading a passage or keeping the classroom clean to how to deal with an abusive classmate or the first love .
If that much is at stake then education can not be aimed to learning facts only .
There are also other reasons that support the statement that education must be based on the understanding of ideas as well on the acquiring of skills .
First , skills as well as the understanding of ideas last forever and they are universal .
The processes involved can be used anywhere , anymoment .

Second , they serve as tools for dealing with a less narrow variety of situations as opposed with the memorization process that is involved in the learning of a fact .
And as tools they can be used to find new and alternative ways to apply the same ideas .

Third , they improve your abbility of making connections which is very important nowadays when knowledge is too vast to grasp .

Finally , they can be custumized to every student 's needs .
Facts imply that every one should memorize them in the same way while if the teacher is taking in account the personal abbilities of each person then a personal approach is rea I believe that when teacher and students only want to study and learn facts they will enclose the knowledge and they will narrow their opportunities to develop in a world that has become more and more ecclectic .

Even though the statement referes only to the students , teachers have a great deal to learn , first they should discover what motivates them to teach in a certain way and then they should evaluate whether their methods are reaching more that memory or if otherwise they are helping students to reach higher standarsds .

"I agree with the statement proposed , here is why .
Education has walked a long way to become what it is today .
Take your father 's class and you will be confronted by a `` memory rules '' approach .
Everything has changed and the place of the memory is one of the biggest victim of this evolution .

`` Learning facts '' has the fatal flaw of beign associated with memory , otherwise , how you will remember a date , an event or the name of one president ? .
A fact is just a tale of something that happend .

The last couple of years saw an increase in education research .
tens of theories has been proposed and in some cases , has been tested .
One has emerged as the current champion : Constructivity .

Constructivity means that everything we are going to learn has to be builted on the shoulders of something we already know .
That way , we are not dealing with a million of separate facts to remember but with a few knowladge networks that will activate a couple of related ideas every single time we touch one of the ideas belonging to the same network .

What 's the magic of these ? , that studies had proved that we have three tipes of memory , a short-term , a mid-term and a long term one .

Short term allow us to dig a lot of information but to lose it fast , medium will let us remember that we have touched the subject , but the details will be gone .
Long term memory is composed of all the things that impact us in a unusual way or the things we use every day .
Constructivity tries to place our knowladge in the medium and large-term area by changing the frecuency of use .

"LEARNING IDEAS FOR UNDERSTANDING FACTS

When students first start a course , they want to know what the methodology of the class is goin to be .
Students are interested in knowing the curriculum and the course description .
Once they know all of these details , the teacher helps them reach the proposed goals .
Every course a student attends , exposes him/her to learn facts and to understand ideas and concepts .
However , for students is more important understanding ideas and concepts than learning a certain fact .

Nowadays , there is an approach to teaching pedagogy called learning for understanding .
This approach , consists in acquiring knowledge through internalizing ideas and concepts .
In other words , the learning for understanding approach , stands that once a student is able to understand a concept or and idea , he will easily learn the facts that support it .

Although this approach is not directly exposed to the students , they unconsciously prefer to learn facts by understanding the concepts and ideas on which it is founded .
A student , finds it more interesting to discuss , to explore or simply to inquire on a theme .
Therefore , once they have a reason to research , they start to inquire .
In this way , students are able to learn from details , conjectures , opinions , concepts and ideas to be capable to reach the facts that support the investigation .

This is a kind of inductive method to acquire knowledge .
It can be boring for a student to start with theoretical facts just to discover new ideas , because the student will be first exposed to a list of theoretical concepts that may demotivate his learning process .
On the contrary , if the student is guided to an inquiry , he will be interested in questioning , exploring , debating and understanding facts .

Finally , the process of learning should captures a students ' attention with any kind of motivation , and what really motivates students is to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn a list of facts .
And this conclusion has to become a fact to keep in mind because this new approach can encourage teachers to change their pedagogic ass .

"I am totally agree .
In elementary school teachers show an old way to learn about everything , specially areas of study like history , literature , geography , philosophie or civism has taken by students like a bunch of names , dates and facts that they have to memorize .

Nowdays I figured out that memorize facts is not the best way to understand .
In Graduate School I had the oportunitie of take a lot of understandable classes that I can still remember .

The best way to learn and understand at the same time is doing more than one reading , consult more than one book or one opinion about something so you can have more than one point of view .
For example , if I have to investigate about Modern Architecture may be I can talk about La Ville Savoye of Le Corbusier in Poissy , France , 1929 .
But the only thing I am doing there is taking some information that already exist and writing it down in my paper .
That is just a transcription .

But in stead of that if I try to understand the philosophical fundaments of the Modern Movement , the reasons of Le Corbusier that made him design a diferent kind of building ( never seem untill that year ) and explain the origins and reasons of this architecture I will surely explain to everybody , including mysefl the results of my investigation making not just remember it but know the who , when , and most important of al , the why .

So I definitly think it is more important for students ( and for life if you think a little more about it ) to understand ideas and concepts .
It is known that a good student is the one who can explain himself all kind of concepts that the one who just has memorized a lot of information that ast least its worthless .

"Refering to the statement I believe thet it 's very complex to find the real difference between the two of them .
I have some important reasons to think like that .
I 'm also student on the univesity actually and my experience is that there are two kinds of students .
One that not use to go to class and try to study all the book during the week before .
And second there is the student that always goes to class and take notes so that 's why when he has the exam he do n't need to spent so much time inm front of the book .

However , both of them use to pass the exam but using diferrent ways .
The method of study is as important as the way that you practice to memorice the ideas or facts .

From my point of view it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
In order to explain this I will give an example .

- Imagine a situation with a student learning a complex theme of antropology at university four years ago .
It 's not equal if he had studied the theme by understanding the main ideas instead of learning facts .
Be sure that he will remember perfectly if he had undestanded the idea during that class .
I believe that facts are confusing according to my experience .

In conclussion , the difference between learning and understanding really does n't matter in my opinion , the important point is that with both of them the student is learning even facts or ideas that he will use on the future maybe working or teaching other students .
So depending on the study it would be better oin way or the other one the thing is to choose the right one .
",P7,SPA,high,0
"I agree with this statement .
I do n't mean that facts and learning about them is not important .
But the complete understanding of something comes with the acknowledgement of its basis .
Ideas and concepts are the base in wich knowledge and progress are built on .
So it 's essential for a student to manage the ideas and concepts of a topic of study , to be capable of completely understanding everything about it and to work correctly with its facts .

When a student approaches his learning process , he must go through two moments .
First , the understanding of the basic concepts of the topic that he 's studying .
He must be able to manage and handle all the basic ideas and knowledge of what his studying .
And then analizyng the facts .
In this second moment the student , using his previous results , the student compares and associates the concepts and ideas he learned earlier with the facts that are given to him .
This way the student can fully learn about the topic and generate conclusion , that are correct and useful in his and in others whole educational process .

Teacher should point out process like these , so they could get much better results out of their teaching and could more accourately reach their goals .
And student could really be prepare and could really trust that they have a solid educational formation .

So in conclusion , it 's not that knowing about ideas and concepts is more important than knowing about facts .
Is that the proper learning of basic concepts can lead to a better use and to a better understanding of facts .
If students reallly want to reach a correct use of their knowledge , they must know everything about the concepts and ideas that they are working with .
And teachers must make their structure of teaching easier to point out the basics ideas .
",P7,SPA,high,0
"There is this theory that it is more importante for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , I desagree .

I believe a student should both learn facts and understand ideas and concepts , because good education must be based on both rather than focussing on one or the other .

For instance , a student must understand the concept of democracy in order to study history , but he also must learn some relevant events in history to fully understand the meaning of the concept democracy .

I believe the learning of facts is not contrary to the understanding of ideas and concepts , in the long run , you may forget a lot of the facts you were thought , but at some point they were absolutelly necessary to understand the underlying concepts and ideas .

Throughout ones life we forget and learn facts as we continue in the process of understanding new concepts and ideas .

An education based solely on facts will produce students who are unable to conect those facts and produce original ideas and opinions , while an education based exclusivelly on understanding will make for adults not fit to interact in a cultivated enviroment .

The basic approach to education has changed significantly in the last 50 years , our parents were thought rough facts , they were forced to memorize endless ammount of information to be repeated over and over again , while younger generations were brought up under the impresion that memorizing facts is useless , in my opinion , neither is desirable , nor the student who is full of facts but lacks in analisys , nor the student who doesnt know the names or the most important capitals of the world or the basic facts in its countrys history .

I also believe education should be balance because students will be likely to study in diferent institutions throughout their lives and a well rounded education allows them to better adapt to the different teachig methodologies and approaches to education that each particular institution has .
",P7,SPA,high,0
"In my opinion , I agree with this statement because I believe that understanding the whole context of an specific topic , in other words , capturing the ideas and concepts , would allow a student to develop a better meaning of what he is learning which could be reinforce with the different facts described during the course .

For example , when I was a attending classes at university , I always tried to pay more attention to the main ideas the professor was trying to explain , which does not mean that I found facts less important , but in my case , I knew that in order to understand and facilitate my studying for an exam , it would better if I could develop the topic thinking in a different way and not just memorizing each word he said or each fact stated .
Nevertheless , facts would help me have more specific details about the class but if I have just learned facts or be more interested in them than in concepts probably I would forget those facts faster and may have more problems in answering questions that were not asked during the class because I did not understand what the main idea was about or what the professor was trying to teach us .

Another important example why I am convinced ideas and concepts worth more than facts is related with the way we understand how a singular topic in real life is being developed .
For instance , most students have a knowledge on how a country 's economy works or why it is important to have accountants in a company without needing to study Economics or Finance just by understanding the concept of free markets and how important finance are for companies to succeed .

Students are going to have a better knowledge of what they are learning if teachers put mpre emphasis on the ideas and concepts rather than facts .

"People can learn through different methods .
Some have an easiness for remembering charts , pictures or other graphics while others learn faster by literal means .
The quality of the retention of those facts varies according to the way they retain them .

When a student understands the idea of what he is doing , he can implement observations of his own .
When one understands something , it is much more probable to imply or discover the rest of the details .
He may even add new ideas .
Once you get the big picture of one concept and understand it , your mind can analyze it , judge it and compare it to former experiences .
Understanding a concept makes it last much longer in the memory .
We have a limited memorization time and space .
For example , if you memorize your credit card number , you will remember it for a period of time .
Once you stop using that number , the most probable thing is that you will forget it in a few months .
Our memory works best when we put to practice concepts and understand their functions and structures .

On the other hand , simply learning facts leads to being able to hold back more details .
You may know everything there is to know about a certain theme , but if you cannot understand it , you cannot change it or handle it .
Think of it this way .
Pretend you make a new friend .
You may have read about this person before .
You may know everything about him , from his blood type , to his hobbies , to his tastes , even his habits .
If you do not understand the person , you cannot deal with him , or even maintain a lasting friendship .
To truly know that person you must not only know about him , but also know him .

To conclude , my opinion is that it is more important if you can understand rather than just retain facts .
When you understand , you have the ability to change it , experiment it and even handle it .
If the knowledge of a student is going to last him for a lifetime , the best way of remembering facts is to understand them .

"In general , I would say that both are important and they complement to each other .
In my experience , I would say that it is more advantageous for students to undertand ideas and concepts than to learn facts ; although , this may not be true in all cases .

Firstly , the study of facts is based on the understanding of concepts and ideas .
It is not possible for a student to understand properly a fact if he or she does not have a basic knowledge of the ideas an concepts which constitute the basis of these facts .

Secondly , while the study of facts is based on memory , the study of ideas and concepts allows students to use their reasoning in order to understand the causes and effects of things or facts .
The understanding of concepts allow them to establish relationships between different concepts as well as their causes and effects .

However , it is also important to take into consideration that each educational method has its own advatages or disadvantages according to the student .
For some students it is easier to learn through facts , while other students understand better through concepts and ides .
These differences depend on the type on intelligence of the student .

The study based on the understanding of concepts or facts varies according to each profession .
For example , philosophers learn based on abstract concepts and ideas ; which they identify in facts .
On the contrary ,

I conslusion , I belive that understanding ideas and concepts provide students with more valuable tools and skills for their future lifes .

Regarding teaching methods , some believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Both teaching methods are highly used in all over the world , but when it comes to my teaching method , I am a clear defender that it is far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn plain and simple facts .

It dose n't require any type of creativity for a student to understand a fact .
Facts are facts .
Facts cannot be developed nor changed .
On the other hand , ideas and concepts require creativity and development .
By teaching students to understand an idea , you are teaching him the why and how of the fact .
You are fostering the student to think about it , analize it and reach his own conclusion - a conclusion that with time , will develop in

Take the example of a teacher who is trying to teach his student not to swear at other people .
If he would tell him not to swear beacause swearing is against the kinder-garden rules and it sounds bad ( which are facts ) , the kid is most likely to stop swearing because those are the rules , he was told not to , not beacause he has understood the concept of morale , or because he regrets hurting people .
If we teach him the idea , the concept about swearing and all its consequenses ( which are such and such ) , the kid can truly understand why not to swear .

By teaching our students the idea and the concepts behind the facts that control our lives , we are encouraging our students to become flexible , analize and have a mind of their own .
We are forstering students who do not only know the facts , but also know the why and the how of facts .

"I will begin my essay by saying that I agree with this statement , and then I will go on in explaining why I feel this way .
Based on my own experience as a student , the most rewarding knowledge is the one that is cultivated by hard work , and understanding of the great ideas that are behind the facts that are exposed to us .

From what I can remember , the things that I consider I have really learned in my life as a student are those that came from the process of trying to understand the logic and the dynamic of the problem I was challenged to study , as opposed to those things that I tried to learned by memorizing dates , names and places .

If anything , the only time when I have really come to learn and acknowledge important dates and names in a relevant process in history , it is because I have taken the time to understand the logic of the historical sequence , so that I can place the events according to the ideas and concepts that are behind each episode in history .

Those students that learn only facts with nothing behind them , will sure be forgetting what they learned within a month , because the learning process did n't come form understanding the importance of those facts in an specific situation .
The learning process , in the case of those students , came from the need to be passing through the courses , tests , and exams , without knowing if the things they were asked to know were importante in their lifes , or their carrers .

Aside from that , I believe that ideas and concepts are tools that students have for their ongoing studies , and also for life .
Once a person has studied a concept , and has struggled with the logic of it , and has finally succeded into understanding it , that concept will last on in their minds forever as a tool to understand other processes , or other concepts .

"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Stepping out of one's comfort zone and challenging oneself with new experiences is essential for personal growth and success.

Firstly, trying new things and taking risks allows individuals to expand their knowledge and skills. By venturing into uncharted territory, one can learn valuable lessons and gain insights that may not have been possible by sticking to familiar tasks. For example, successful entrepreneurs often credit their willingness to take risks and innovate as key factors in their achievements.

Secondly, embracing new challenges can lead to increased creativity and problem-solving abilities. When faced with unfamiliar situations, individuals are forced to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions. This ability to adapt and think creatively is crucial in today's rapidly changing world.

Moreover, taking risks can lead to greater opportunities and rewards. Success often lies at the intersection of preparation and opportunity, and by being open to new experiences, individuals increase their chances of stumbling upon unexpected opportunities that can propel them towards success.

In conclusion, successful people are not afraid to step out of their comfort zones, try new things, and take risks. By doing so, they open themselves up to a world of possibilities, growth, and success.",P8,SPA,high,1
"I strongly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well. Throughout history, we see countless examples of individuals who achieved greatness by stepping out of their comfort zones and embracing challenges.

Take, for instance, the story of Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb. Edison failed over a thousand times before successfully creating a working prototype. His willingness to take risks and try new approaches ultimately led to one of the most significant inventions of the modern era.

Moreover, successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk continually push the boundaries of innovation by venturing into new industries and taking risks that others might shy away from. Musk's ventures into electric cars, space travel, and renewable energy demonstrate the power of trying new things and embracing uncertainty.

In my opinion, success is not just about doing what you know well but about continually learning, growing, and challenging yourself. By stepping outside of their comfort zones, successful individuals open themselves up to new opportunities for growth and innovation.

"Title: The Path to Success: Embracing Risk and Trying New Things

In the pursuit of success, the willingness to step out of one's comfort zone and take risks is paramount. While sticking to what one knows well may seem safe, it is only through trying new things that true growth and achievement can be realized. Do you agree that successful people are characterized by their openness to new experiences and their courage to take risks?

By embracing new challenges and unfamiliar tasks, individuals not only expand their skill sets but also cultivate resilience and adaptability. Success often lies beyond the boundaries of familiarity, waiting to be discovered by those bold enough to venture into uncharted territories. Take, for example, the groundbreaking innovations of companies like Apple and Tesla. Their success can be attributed to their willingness to push the boundaries of conventional thinking and take risks that others deemed too risky.

Furthermore, trying new things fosters creativity and fosters innovation. When individuals are open to experimentation, they are more likely to stumble upon novel solutions and unique perspectives that set them apart from the competition. By contrast, those who only stick to what they already know may find themselves trapped in a cycle of stagnation, unable to break free from the confines of their comfort zones.

In conclusion, while it may be tempting to stick to what we know best, it is the willingness to try new things and take risks that ultimately propels individuals towards success. As the saying goes, ""fortune favors the bold."" So, do you dare to step outside your comfort zone and embrace the unknown in pursuit of success?",P8,SPA,high,1

By embracing challenges and exploring unfamiliar territories, individuals can broaden their skill sets, gain new perspectives, and discover hidden talents that they never knew they had. This willingness to take risks and embrace change is often what sets successful people apart from the rest.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that success is not about sticking to what you already know how to do well, but rather about venturing into uncharted waters, taking risks, and seizing new opportunities. By embracing challenges and stepping outside of their comfort zones, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve greatness.",P8,SPA,high,1
"Title: The Path to Success: Embracing New Challenges and Risks

In the pursuit of success, some argue that sticking to what one already knows how to do well is the key to achieving greatness. However, I firmly believe that successful individuals are those who are willing to step out of their comfort zones, try new things, and take risks. By challenging themselves and exploring unfamiliar territories, they not only expand their abilities but also open doors to new opportunities and growth.

Isn't it true that growth only happens when we push ourselves beyond our limits and expose ourselves to new experiences? Imagine if great innovators like Elon Musk or Steve Jobs had chosen to play it safe and stick to what they already knew. The world would have missed out on groundbreaking technologies like Tesla cars and the iPhone.

Furthermore, taking risks can lead to unexpected rewards and personal development. When we dare to venture into uncharted waters, we learn valuable lessons, gain resilience, and develop a mindset that embraces change and uncertainty.

In conclusion, success is not solely about mastering what we already know but also about venturing into the unknown, embracing challenges, and taking calculated risks. So, I ask you, dear reader, are you willing to step out of your comfort zone and seize the opportunities that lie beyond familiarity?",P8,SPA,high,1
"I do agree with the previous statement , for I am convinced that people who try new things are able to innovate and discover new trains of thought that would otherwise not be discovered .
If these people only did what they already already know how to do well , they would always experience the same results , feeling that they do not bring much added value to the society they live in .

Moreover , by taking risks and daring to go where no other individuals have gone , successful people are not only driving forces of their communities , but also leaders that motivate other people to achieve their own goals .

I will further support my view with the following approaches :

- Psychological considerations .
- My own experience .

As an Industrial Engineer from the Mexican Institute of Technology , I acquired a thorough quantitative and analytical grounding .
Fortunately , my coursework also included studying behavioural finance , subject that enabled me to find an interest in psychology , social science I found complemented my understanding of efficiency and the human factor particularly well .

Through reading extensively on the subject , I began feeling a particular appeal for the works of T.J. Walker , an outstanding social researcher who has focused on the practical aspects of psycho-sociology particularly well .
In one of his books , `` Riddles of the Human Mind '' , he explicitly entails the topic of innovation and risk taking .

He mentions that people who are able to innovate and take risks in order to achive their goals are usually much more self-fulfilled individuals .
They are also much more goal oriented and able to motivate people more effectively .

In my country there is an old saying that says that `` what one has eaten , travelled and danced is one 's to keep and can never be taken away . ''
This is indeed a wise saying that I myself have witnessed with my own experience .

I have travelled many countries , and in every case I have been exposed to new experiences that have tempered my criterion and made me more open to people 's views , ideas and approaches .
Since I try to befriend people from the places I visit , this insight turns even more vivid for me as I am able to share a much more personal experience by doing so .

During one of my trips I faced the problem of having to deal with individuals who were always affraid of taking risks and doing things differently .
However , after talking to them , I finally convinced them of approaching life with a different view , so they realized that they were able to experience much more personal satisfaction by doing things differently and by deciding freely how to deal with a particular topic .

In closing this presentation , I ponder upon the fact that many of us who work in Banking tend to present our ideas in an overwrought manner , and that in claryfing our views we end up complicating them even further .

However , in analyzing the complex issue of trying new things and taking risks , I also do not want to appear simplistic , but instead try to maintain my presentation candid and simple , convinced of Martin Fisher 's quote that `` knowledge is a process of piling up facts , wisdom lies in their simplification .

"Well , I dont think success is a resultant of experiencing risks .
Risk may help to prove oneself new ways of doing things ; new possibilities to aboard issues or face fears and conventionalities .
But I really dont think that by taking risks one can assure for its life success .
The main problem that I detect on the statement is that the concept of success is limited to the risk one .
Fisrt of all we should define what those terms stand for in modern society in order to really understand what are the possibilities involved in that particular process .

For instance , I could be very succesful without risking anything in my life .
I may have proven formulas that have worked for me all my life and that not necessarily make me a succesful person in terms of money and fame , but in my own reference terms , that could be anything regarding a good quality of life , or even not simply that .
If we try to make a general analysis about what is beleived in modern societies that succes may bring to a person , the arguments would orbit around phraes like `` money eventually can make you succesful '' , the same thing with fame .

So , why is money and fame the two main references to explain succes from my point of view ?
Because those concepts are the ones that prevail in modern capitalist societies .
Yes , capitalism , far from all the so-called economic benefits that it supposes for mankind , it has also produced a terrible social need for material whealt in order to expose social status and succes .
I may finish my toughts on this topic by referencing the one and only clue to understand postmodernity : `` the more you buy , the more you are ''

"I completely agree with this statement .
When people try to innovate in a certain matter they are using all their capacities to obtain success .
Risking yourself will give you courage that will help you to continue the path you have proposed yourself .

All the people live with the capacity of making some improvement in something .
Some take advantage of this , some others do not .
When people try to go through the easy path , they know they will have less posibilities to fail but that they will not be able to succed .

Success is something that comes only when you really put effort in something , the most classic example would be someone trying to open a certain shop .
If that person works hard and take the risk to sell something innovating they will not always be able to grow economically but spiritually .
Knowing thay you tried best you can will be the best reward you will ever gain .

But here comes the point were we shoud ask , what is success ?
Is it obtaining economicall profit ?
Or maybe is more than that ?
Success is not something material , success is something that comes when you know you are making something you were ment to be , no matter what the odds were .
Trying hard and failing , so you have the chance to try again is the path to succes .
This is not something you will obtain by following normal patterns of behaviour or conduct .
Putting yourself in difficult situations and unpredictable scenarios makes you work at all your capacity and the reward for this is plainly success .
A man that declines a transference of his workplace to a place were he would earn more money so he can stay more time with his family , will become a succesful person .
He wo n't have economicall beneficts , but the satisfaction that his desition brought him will make him know that he triumphed in life , that he is really succesfull .

Succes will not come to people that are blindly following patterns and doing only what they think they can do , it 's in the action of taking risks were people are able to discover what they are really capable of and as a result become successful persons .

"The success of a person is only measured on a just way by himself .
If it is not a persons priority to live in luxury but with knowledge we ca n't assume he is not successful if he does not have a big house and a big SUV .
We can acknowledge that he has had success in his life because he reached his goals .

Even so , it is my belief that people that succeed in their goals are people that have to , on some circumstances , take the risk and play their chances to what they believe in .
If you do only what you know what to do well , you will only do what you were taught .
And you wo n't stand out from the rest and succeed if you do only what everyone does .

People follow patterns in their everyday lives .
Many even have routines and feel secure with them , but the key to succeed in life is to take risks when you have to and play to your strenghts .

Not everyone is the same in attitudes and experiences , but the fact that someone has knowledge and information equal to that which we possess is a possibility , the difference comes to what we decide to do with what everyone knows and what makes you special .

When we try to leave possitive mark in the world and its inhabitants day by day , we are succeeding on a level of moral fiber and character .
Then , that kind of success will translate into a series of events that lead to what we chose when we decided what we would do with our lives .

Its hard to fail and believe that we have not succeded , we are forced to believe that because we failed some prototype imprinted to us by someone or something , but if we are really whole and concient people , we will see that to fail to ourselves is the only way to fail in life .

Money , fame and women are n't success unless you want to think so that way .
Media gives us a vision of of what is according to them a true successful life , but it is we who make the choice of what to believe .
Success innovates , success creates , but more than anything , success gives you peace and interior calm .

"I completely agree that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well .

First , to succed you need to take risks .
Probably everyone that has succeded in their lives has taken risks .
And when you take a risk it does n't mean that you are going to succed for sure .

When you are going to start a new proyect , when you are going to start running your own buisness or if you are going to take a posdoctoral education for example you are usually entering into an unknown field , in a place wihich you are not familiarized with and where you are going to make probably many mistakes and failing exams .
But that is the only way to succed , trying , making mistakes , and the most important thing , learning from them .

By the contrary , of course you can just do what you already know and do n't want to go further in your knowledgent or education .
There is nothing wrong with that point , but your life and knowledgent are going to be limited only in what you know .
You are not even going to be a specialist in what you think you are good at , because to be a specialist you need to study more , take new exams and take new risks .

Nowdays we live in a very competitive world where you need to know everyday something new and you need to be updating your knowlegment , taking continuing education courses etc .
Probably if you are going to look for a new job the most qualified candidate is the one that is going to be chosen .
The same happens with students : we need to further our education in order to be more competitive to be accepted for example in a college .
And the only way to do that is taking risks everyday .
For studying purposes , we need sometime to retake an exam in order to have a competitive score since all students are very qualified .

In conclussion , taking risks will allow us to be more competent , qualified and succesfull in our lives

"I do believe successful people try new things and take risks .
I believe life is full of opportunities that can benefit us , but we have to be ready and willing to accept this opportunities .

If a person just sits around and keeps doing the same than his/her life will become in a rutine .
Risks are always good because they motivate the person and makes a person give it 's best to achieve it 's personal goals , It 's always good to try new things .
A person has to look at it in a way that if nothing comes out of this than its not a lost , its actually a win , because you earned experience .

Experience is a very valuable gift a person acquires over time .
Nobody is born with experience , life gives a person the experience required to become successful and not fail .
Successful people have already obtained a certain degree of experience that has taken them to the spot they are located at .
A good example of how experience helps and is acquaired would be that a guy recently graduated with a business major , would n't be able to run a company by itself .
He probably has the knowledge , but not the experience to know what to do , or what decisions he needs to take , or how the company is run .

Important personalities in life have taken risks .
One good example is Cristopher Columbus .
He took the risk of sailing through the ocean , because he had a dream that the earth was round , and not flat like everybody said it was .
He took that risk and he had a great outcome , he found America .
If he would sat around and just believed what everybody else was believing in and just traveling in the same route everybody was , than he would n't have never found the glory he found when he decided to take that risk .

Life is full of risks , and we have to be well prepared in order to confront them , and when they come we do n't have to be afraid of taking them because we do n't know what we might found or the outcome of them will be .

"A lot of people want to be successful , and they try to succeed in different ways .
Some people prefer to take risks and try new things , while others prefer to succeed by doing things that they master .
I always succeed because I do things that I do well .
I do n't like to feel the uncertainty of doing something new , I do n't like to make mistakes , and I do n't like to waste my money .

Primarily , when I do something new , I do not know what is going to be the result .
I feel better when I have the certainty of the things , and I always succeed .
I need to turn unknown things into known things because I will have more probability to do better things in my life .

I have been successful all my life because I always try to master the performance of many activities in my daily life .
Secondarily , doing new things inplies many mistakes because people have to try many times in order to improve their performance .
When people make mistakes often , they can lose credibility with other people .
If other people are observing me , I try to perform better my activities .
Finally , trying new things offers the invovenience of spending a lot of money .
Each effort has a high cost because the possibility of failure is great when I do new things .
Experiencing with new trhings requires either new material and equipment or more people .
All these resources are very expensive .
Therefore , I prefer to save money and do things that I do well .

Successful people do things in a different manner .
While some of them try to do somethiong new , others do thigs that they do well .
I do not like to take risks in my life , so I try to do things well all the time .

"What makes a person successful ?
Is it the amount of money they make , the car they bought with it , or the house they live in ?
I believe that success is more than just having a lot of money .
To be a successful individual a person has to go through many obstacles without stoping , and has to have a clear vision of the future .

We may find someone that is really good in a certain task .
But success is not just being good at something .
I believe that it means to be the best at it .
In the present times people go through life trying to grasp anything they can get .
There 's no such thing as easy money .
Because of the dificulty of getting a job , paying bills , and having enough money to pay for your child 's $ 30,000 per year education , many people have found themselves absorbed by life 's preassure .
They stoped thinking about the future and have focus in the present .

I believe people have become conformists and many mediocre .
They are tired of working so hard and not improoving , so when they finally find something that 's OK , they 'll stay with it because they are too afraid of loosing the little something they 've got .
Most humans do n't feel confortable in an unknown environment .
This makes it hard for these people to take a risk and move towards the unexplored .
They do n't care if it 'll bring something better .
The fear of change disables them to become better .

So a successful person is not the one that stays with what he or she already knows how to do well , but rather that other person who takes the risk and searches for self improovement .
It is not enough to have one goal in life .
What are you supposed to do when you acomplish it ?
Are you done ?
Is there no other reason for you to keep on living ?
I truellly think that a successful person will always have something more to acomplish .

"I believe successful people like to take risks and are not afraid to engage new situations .
Success is being in control of one self in order to achieved certain goals .
If you believe you can do it , you have much higher chances to obtaining that .
Successful people are motivated to try new things , to be creative , and to follow objectives even if the situation changes .

Successfull people differ from ordinary people becasue they take risks .
For example : Most of all great business ideas are innovative .
What makes a business man successful is the way he or she manages to develop the business model .
Most probably , it will requiere to invest both time and money to an entrepeneur activity .
It will also requiere to learn new things , maybe processes and managerial skills .
To do so , it demands to learn new things and to take risks .

In the other hand , ordinary people are most likely to stay where they are , in what I call comfort zone .
They are not willing to take chances , and usually bypass great oportunities because they believe that it is too risky or too hard to achieve .

Basically , I differentiate people by their attitud .
Successful ones , have a positive attitud toward change and are self confident .
They believe thay can achieve it .
And even if they fail , their attitud rise them up again to keep on developing greater ideas .
Success is a continious activity , not a goal you reach and it is over .

They are many examples of success .
I like to state my own experience .
I have worked for 3 years achieving professional goals , and learning new activities .
I have been recognized for my committment , and now I work as General Manager for the company .
I have great attitud toward change and problem solution .
I have made my mistakes but always learned from them .

"Personally I strongly disagree with the idea that successful people try new things or are risky people .
Mistakenly since the beginning of the century , it has been believed that the reasons for success of some people who had started large companies were that they had introduced new concepts doing something different , and had taken risks .
On the other hand , I believe that the reason for success are hard work , motivation and imagination .

First I think that hard work usually fosters success .
For example athlets are clear examples .
The more and the harder they train , the better results they get .
It is clear that athlets that get first positions in swimming races are not just risk people .
Furthermore in academics or labor enviroument , the continuous effort is a valued factor .
For instance Novel prizes are awared for work along several years and not just for one isolated paper or idea .

In the second place , imagination ( and not just trying something new ) is crucial for success ( which is reaching a goal ) .
Some people who we consider successful such as Thomas Edison , or Albet Einstain , were people with a huge imagination , and therefore they were able to introduce innovations or new theories .

Finally , motivation is the main factor for success .
Even if a person has the skill , the discipline and imagination , if s/he is not motivated nothing will show up .
Motivation is the willingness or the reaons for reaching a goal .
For example several history acadamics explain that successfull people as athlets , business men , or scientist usually are inspired in a fact as solving a problem , illness , or to honor their parents , etc .

"`` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know hoe to do well '' .
This statment is often said about people and what they should do in order to be successful .
Succes is measured by what you have accomplished .
In life if you take risks your are going to be more successful because your are going to get better at what you do , improve in some areas and learn .

First , if you take risks you are going to get better at what you do because you are going to have more practice .
Having more practice you can see what you are better at and what things you should improve .
One day my friend was really scared about making a decision because what if she failed .
The first times she tried she was right , she failed .
But with practice the teacher is born .
She became so good at what she did that she was more successful .

Second , you are going to improve your qualities .
Like my friend , she realized what areas she could change and improve them in order to be better .
If you dont take a risk you are always going to be good , and thats all .
You want to be great at everything and sometimes we just need a little push and courage to know that at first maybe its not going to be better , but at the end of the road you are improving in every single way .

Third , by taking risks and chances you are learning .
Learning is the most important quality .
If you learn from your mistakes and from the things you are good at , you can combine the knowledge and create something wonderful .

People are successful because of what they do , the things they create and what they are good for .
Every person during their lifetime has to take a chance , risk what they have .
If they dont they are never going to be great , just good at what they are .
But if they do decide to take a risk they are going to learn so much more that even if they fail they gain more knowledge than a person who didnt take a risk .
This is why successful people take risks , to gain to knowledge of different things , and to be great at what they do .

"Nowadays , only few people take risks .
This happens because everybody to be sure that what they are doing will be successful .
The problem with this approach is that if a person do n't take risk , the benefits are the same as the average .

One example of risk are sports , the mayority of persons that participate in an event , such a marathon , know how to train and what it should be done to finish the race ; but only some of them win the race , and these specific individuals usually not only win one competition but a lots .
These ones are successful in reaching their goal not because they know what it was , but because they have trained to the limits of their body and went beyond them .
This approach is the correct to success in life .

This teach us that in order to success a person has to know what is the goal he wants to achieve .
After that , this individual has to understand the path he has to follow to get this goal .
Because a lot of people should be looking for this goal and following the same steps , it is important to stand out of the crowd .
This is where innovation takes part of it .

Persons need to know that even if is well known paths all people advices you to follow , it is important to also know there are other unexplored roads to take .

In my life I have experience some situations that have helped me to understand this , for example , I had the same job for about three years , and I was sure it was doing in right because I always did everything my boss told me to .
I get a raise once but never was promoted , which was my goal .
So , after three years I changed my attitude and start to participate more in the projects , I got involved more in my co-workers ' tasks and working more hours I they ask me to , after two months I was promoted .

In conclusion , it is important to take risks to stand of the crowd , if you do n't do it , you just have the average results everybody can get .

"A person that is successfull or wants to be successfull likes to try new things and take risks in life instead of doing only what they know they are good at .
This might be because a truly successfull person knows that an unending process of learning is what being successfull is all about .
When you try new things you learn and see things you did not know about and your perception becaomes wiser , your knowledge is expanded .
When you do something only because you know you are skilled at it you are denying your your chance to explore the other possibilities and innovations the world can offer .

Therefore , I consider my mom to be a very successfull and lawyer and human being .
She is a person that has travelled to many countries , and consequently has been to three different continents .
She has seen many cultures , even experienced many cultures and has perceived the definition of justice other countries have .
She has gained experience because of this and implemented it in her work , she even visited prisons to get to know cases and approach the venezuelan legal system a different .
All of these experiences made her a successfull lawyer that even worked with the government and defended well known officials of the government .

On the otherhand , one can be and wants to be successfull in many aspects of life , especially , in one very essential which is love .
My cousin had a crush on girl for three years and acted like her best friend when in fact he loved her .
He was an amazing friend and was very good in that position , he resignated to being that because he was afraid if he told her his feelings she would reject him .
Finally , after me and his friends convinced him , he took the risk of asking her and telling her what he truly felt .
She felt the same about , so by being strong and courageous enough my cousin felt happy and very successfull .

Adquiring experience by trying new things sometimes usefull , sometimes even a waste of time makes you grow as a person and increases your knowledge .

"Being successful in life is something that we all desire , unluckily only a few ones will manage to get it .
Personally , I think that success depends on many things and not only on taking risks because if you want to be the number one on something , you need to be born with certain skills , give the best of you and to make an important sacrifice .

Some people may agree in saying that being succesful means to break the rules , However you can not break any rule if you do not know how rules work first .
I mean , if you want to be the best at playing soccer , you need to know that there are certain rules that you are suppose to follow , like team work , solidarity , understanding your mates etc .

in this case , to think that you will become the best football player in the world by doing whatever you want and not paying any attention at all to any recomendation is absolutely nonsense .
Obviously , when you behave like this , you are taking a risk , but that risk is ridiculous and naive .

I wholeheartedly believe that if you ever dream of being a successfull man , sometimes you will have to take a risky step , but that step can not be taken without having the previous knowledge about something or withouth being fully aware of the consequences .

The fact that we live in a society that everyday demands more and more , makes us think that if we do not gain sucess we are nothing .
Nevertheless , success is not a matter of being the best at something , but being the best in all these small things that we do in our everyday life .

A realistic example is my personal experience .
I was born and raised in Puerto Rico .
I completed my highschool and undergraduate college degrees in Puerto Rico .
In my country , most rich young people attend to american schools and this enables them to be fluent in both language , english and spanish .
Even though that I come from a middle high class family and did n't have the luck of attending to an american school .
I learned english watching television and reading english magazines .
In addition that I attended to an intensive english summer program .
In my junior year of college , I decided to apply for an exchange program at New YorK University and never thought that I was going to get accepted .
So it happened , I did n't get accepted for the Spring semester and was devasted .

In the next upcoming fall semester , I decided to apply again and finally got accepted .

"I do agree .
In fact I would say that this issue marks one of the most important cultural differences between Europe and the United States of America , and that it is one with enormous economic impacts .
While in the USA there is a very strong culture of the succes , exemplified by the working people whose valour and will to reach as high as they can leads them to a great economic succes not only for them but for the entire society , in Europe nowadays economically succesful people is being regarded more and more each year as demons guilty of the misery in which so many people around the world live .
As many modern european intellectual vices this opinion is very likely to be found ( but more as a trend to exhibe than as a reality ) in France .

I must say that when I use the term `` economicaly succesful '' I do not refer to plainly rich people but to people who has achieved to make money by themselves and by a productive activity .
This leaves out speculators and the like .

I will now justify my opinion on the French : french youths nowadays would prefer , in a seventy percent majority , to become civil servants rather than to work in the private sector .
Being a civil servant in France has even more advantages than in the rest of Europe about free services such as health care or education for your children .

However this way of thinking is leading France to not being able to keep up economically with the rest of Europe , and Europe to not being able to keep up economically with globalization in general and with the USA in particular .

On the other hand once you have acquired deep knowledge about something it seems such a pity not to use it , and the labour market usually demands more specialists than entrepreneurs , and much of the features that make the USA so dynamical in economics also create great inequalities in its social tissue not to be seen in Europe , so in this issue as in many other I would suggest to find an equilibrium point instead of clinging to an extreme position .

If you were bold enought to take the risk and you managed to accomplish it in a succesful way you will have gained a lot , yet if you did not accomplish it in an accurate way you still gained a lesson .

Doing what you already know how to do well is a convenient way of spending your life , yet by the time you are older you will realized that you could have made much more .

It is well known that most of the discovers and inventions that build the theories we use today , were discovered by researches that took many risks .
For example , say you are making a research project and you know from theory that by letting the variables unchanged you have big chances to get a certain result .
If you continue with the experiment in this way , you will prove the result you expected , and will have a research project that proved something that was know before .
This does not mean it is not valuable , on the contrary this type of research is also valuable since theories were made years ago and there may be some conditions today that can change the results .
But what if you decide to change a variable and see what it happens , you might be discovering the cure for aids , for example .
In cases like this , taking risks can lead you to succesful events .

There is a mexican saying that states `` if you do not take risks you have less opportunities to win '' .
And it is quite true since by not taking risks you diminish your poll of opportunities .
It is also true that taking risks do not guarantee , every time , a positive outcome it may in fact turn out to be a negative one ; yet you will not know what would happen until you try it .

"There is no one universal way to be successful in life .
We all would like to know the way we could be successful in any or many aspects of our lifes .
But , the reality is that there is not just one way that we can follow that will asure us of being successful .

I believes that one of the many different ways we can try to be successful will be not to be afraid of trying diferent things .
We will not always have the opportunity to try things in a diferent way .
But , everytime time it is possible for us to do what we are trying to do in a different way than the way we are used to do it , we should not be affraid of do it .

There are some people that believes that in order to make a big profit , ones have to take a big risk .
This theory will apply not only in the economics , but also in many other different aspects of our lifes .
We can make big profits or get a lot of beneficits after taking a big risk at school or even in our personal relationships .

In our finances banks usually calculate the interest they will pay you for your money based on the amount of risk that you are taking .
If you want to be very safe with your money you can open a saving account or a CD .
These account will be a very safe way to keep your money but it will not pay you a lot of interest .

You can be safe by staying within your confort zone in an especific area .
Doing that , you will avoid doing things that you may not be good at but it will also limited the amount of areas that you can be successful at .

Tere are many ways in how we can became successful .
It will all depends of the amount of risk that you are willing to take at the time of doing somethings that you have not tried to do before .
Do new things , try different ways , push your limits and see how far you can go .

"Some people is considered successful because they have achieved great success in their careers , but what we have to think about is what makes these people successful ? , is the fact that they only do what they know best or that they take risks by exploring new career paths ? ; I will present some points that have to be considered before agreeing or disagreeing with the statement .

To check more about the subject , let 's see an example : a business man , involved in the development of computer software , has a company on which the people develop computer software products for other companies who could need them .
Maybe he has a degree on Computer Science on which he relies all the knowledge he has about the computer industry , so he could develop products based on the needs of today 's companies just using what he knows ; he only gets to work with things that he is sure that he can handle and he does not try to get involved using new technologies at all .
The company could have a good season , but in this industry you have to be ahead and know what is coming .

The problem with the example listed before , is that there are some times on which people have to take some risks if they want to succeed in their careers , they have to try new things , they have to know where the businesses are going , they have to be aware of the changes made in the world with today 's globalization .
New ways of thinking are coming , new markets have to be explored and new cultures ( companies ) will try to succeed in your own culture , your own market .

Global competition is stronger now and with all this coming in in just a few months , weeks or days , people have to learn how to take risks in new areas , not just in the ones they know well , because today 's companies are trying to get more of the market .
The more knowledge and experience a person could have in several areas , the better he will do in the way of success .

In conclusion , I agree with the statement shown before , because it applies quite right on today 's lifestyle on doing new things on your job , offering new products and services , and getting ready for the globalization phenomenon that is taking place these days .

"Succesful people try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I logically agree with this concept and I think that almost all times hope and a good attitud can make much more than knowledge and money , but the convination of the four things is something amaizing .

The most impportant thing to really succed in your life is achieve your golds , that is the reason you should be persistant ; be proud of yourself , never keeping the felling of knowing that you could do something more , or that you could be part of something but you were too affraid to do it .
Do n't be affraid , trust in yourself , the most important , believe in you !

A great example of succed in the life is my sister , Laura Garza , she is the person that I admire the most ; she is the kind of persons that when she propose something , she gets it , no matter what , no matter how much time it gets , no matter how tired she is , no matter how much it costs .
I realized that when Laura wants to do something , she does it , as easy as that , I really got astonished when I knew she will go to study Clinical Phsycology in Washington , and why , just because she wants to do it , and guess what ?
She is studying in there now .

Succes , what is succes ?
Well , the answer is different to all the people , but the real succes in the life is when you feel comfortable with yourself , when you get up in the mornings and feel you really deserve to be where you are , when you look all around you and finally say : After all my work , I finally get it !
But the most important , you should never give up , you should never think , okeay that is enoght ; because , it is never enought .

You could always be learning and doing something .
I asure you that you will get up , and if you have an open mind and a competitive attitude , you will learn something new everyday .
Just never give up and you will rich your golds , and really succed in your life .

"From my point of view , human life is so complex that the only way to learn valuable aspects is by trying events that we had never tried before .
For instance , an engineer may be a genius in developing complicated mobile phone services , but these services may not appeal to most of the people .
So what he or she should do is concentrate on completely different subjects such as people 's needs and habits .
Probably , he or she has never studied anything related to this , but the only way to obtain success is by trying .

Let 's see another example .
If we worked for Microsoft and we would simply expect to earn money for the current version of Windows , Other company may create a powerfull operating system that would gradually substitute Windows .
That 's why we would have to invest an enormous amount of money on a new operating system .
If we do n't do it well the company will eventually disappear but if we do n't do anything it 's much more likely to disappear .
Nowadays there is much more competitiveness than what it used to be .

Obviously , these measures are always taken after many hours of debate and requiere the support of many workers .
But the point is that if we do not convince ourselves that we have to innovate , then other people will innovate for us and they will be successful but not us .

"People that try new things and that take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well , are considered successfull .

A succesfull person is someone who is open minded .
This person is always willing to do something else , to try new and varied experiences in life , and always learned from the experience .
That person will not care if someday she will have to go to another part of the world , to run an office there , she will only see it as a new ecperience in life and as an adventure .

Another point is to take risks .
Life is full of risks and people should be ready to face them with optimism .
If people stay always doing the same they will live in a monotonous world , and this will only cause them to get bored of what they are doing and stop believing on themselfs .
Instead an optimistic and succesfull person will always find the way of tuning that into an expereince given by life , find the positive side of it , or in other cases they will see this as a lesson to learn , and so they will change what they are doing or the job they are at .

An example of a succesfull person , is someone that , is starting a new company .
This is taken as a risk , but as a risk that is worth trying .
Changing the way of living , that you have always been used to , into a wild and adventurous life , full of travels in which you meet new people , and learn a lesson of life from them , that later on you could apply on a company , is also concidered as a quality .

Humans learn from mistakes , they teach you life lessons that you could only gain by facing new experiences .
Trassspasing the save side of life , and taking risks , in any type of way , no matter if you make mistakes or if you regret it , will always be a price you recive .

"Being a successful person makes yourself responsable on maintaining that success in many different aspects .
I completely agree on the fact that successfull people should try new things and take risk because it will give the person confidence , experience , knowlegde , independence among other characterics that a successful person should have and never forget .

One point in favour is that successful people should try new things to get experience even in things that have anything to do with their area of success .
In fact , a successful person has usually studied before and has a good level of education and experience on its field to achive her o his success correctly .
For example , a successful colombian singer who goes to music school in Colombia and then goes to a music academy in India will have not only the knowledge of Indian music but the experience of being in another country surrounded with a different culture and people .
Furthermore , this will give the Colombian singer a range of new ideas that will probably be reflected in new styles of music , lyrics that he or she will manage to learn and use due to the experience of being in India .

Another point to support the importance of taking risk is the fact that you never know what is going to happen in the future .
Taking a risk being successful helps already because of the prestige that your name already has .
For instance , my dad to the risk of quiting his last job because he wanted an independent company even thou he had a good salary .
However , he manage to create his new coal company with old working partners that he met during a conference in last job where he was very successful as the general administrator of a marine port .
His success and popularity in his last job helped him after many years to gain the confidence and trust of new working partners .

"I totally agree with the statement because I consider if people did n't take their chances and take risks trying to gain something else in reward the world would not be the one we know today .

If hundreds of years ago a crazy guy would n't have taken the risk and tried finding a different route to get by ship to India we would probably still be living in trees and hunting animals to obtain food and the rest of the world would still believe the Earth is n't round .
Or if the Wright Brothers would n't have risked their lives as well as their pride trying to invent a revolutionary way of transportation based on birds it would still take for us weeks or even months to travel from America to Europe .
That 's why I think people should always be willing to take their chances and not be afraid to risk something that in the end might bring an enormous bennefit not only to them but to others as well .

We have always feared what we do n't know and that 's why normally we try only doing what we know to do well , but in my opinion we are the only creature on Earth with the ability to learn something new every day and evolve thanks to those knowledges .
If we have that possibility we might as well try to gain something from using it , or else there would be no difference between a person and an animal .

I also consider that a peson that does n't do anything new in his life and always try to do the same things will end up by not liking what he does .
And even though that person might be successful in life doing what he does it wo n't matter because in the end he wo n't be a happy person which is , in my personal consideration , even more important that success .

In conlcusion I agree with the fact that it 's necessary for us to take risks , we even take them every day when we get up , but it 's only a matter of luck to gain something in return if we not only risk something but also try our best while doing any activity .

"Is is often said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
For example , a business person that has an expanding and growing company will probadly diversify his activities and explore new areas .

The background of this scenery is a feeling of confidence .
Once you can prove to yourself and to others , what you are capable of then appoval is no longer at stake .
You do n't have make a statement on your capacities and inteligence , you have already done that .
Now it is time for the next goal .

And in this line , ambition plays a very important part .
Human beings have a tendency to be unsatisfied .
Once you have reached an aim , another emerges .
As soon as you realise that you were able to do what you had set your mind and spirit to , the following project comes along .

This is a way of maintaining your self steem as high as possible .
Always looking for self realisation on the outside world .
However positive projects are in a person 's life , I believe that other things should be taken into account aswell .
For instance , being able to enjoy what you have produced .
If you are an important Congress man , it is my opinion that before running for President you make the most out of what you are living and feel proud of what you have already accomplished .

Moreover , there has to be a stop in the race for constant success .
Otherwise you might be spending most of your time analysing new projects rather than recognising your achievements .
If you were able to buy a beautiful house thanks to your dedication and hard work , my advice would be to enjoy it and share time with your family instead of working even harder to purchase a bigger one .

All in all , it is my personal opinion that there should be a balance between new aims and enjoying those already met .

"I agree in part with the statement , but I do n't think that those are the only two characteristics a successful person has .
In my opinion , those characteristics are strongly associated , if not derived , from self-confidence .
A person that is self-confident is not afraid of trying new things and taking risks .
In a way it has to be a person that knows that whatever happens there is always a way to make things work .

On the other hand , I disagree in part with the statement because there is a good amount of people who have success and not necessarly take risks or try new things , in fact they do what they know well or are especialized in .

Could it be that success is associated sometimes to luck ?
There has been a lot of people , throughout History that they had a good idea , but it was n't the moment and years later it became a reality .

In my opinion , in order for a person to have success a variaty of factors should come together , such as , personality traits , knowledge and the moment or period of time he or she is born .

Success involves a large scope .
A person may be successful in his or her professional life but he or she is a failure in social aspects .
Taking risks and trying new things may be applicable and a desirable characteristic for a person that runs a business , but I strongly disagree that it will be a desirable trait in a relationship .

So , to call a person successful I consider it is important to see not only a part of a that person 's life and in order to have success characteristics do n't limit only in taking risks and trying new things .

"In my opinion succesfull people ca n't be mesured by the quantity of risks they take , because a man that does not take any risk and focuses on doing what he knows he does very well , can be as succesful as a man that focuses only in taking risks and trying to experiment with new thing everyday .
But using my personal knowledge I can say that each risk you take is an oportunity to win , while each risk you avoid is an oportunity that goes away from you hadns .
As an example I can say about a friend that owned a pizza store , he was always trying new ways of mixing ingredients to produce the best pizza his customers could have ever eaten .
Thanks to his perseverance , this friend invented the best pizza in my city , and after that , with the money he made with the pizza he invented , he tried to invent a snack everybody would buy , and now he is known as Luigi , the father of the Hawaian pizza and the French fries which has helped him to open his own pizza company .

Another good example is my father 's life .
He , as far as I know , was the owner of a great company that used to produce the most comfortable tennis shoes arond the world .
Untill the day he went bankrupt .
His company broke up because , one day my father had to take a very important desicion , unfortunately he chose the easy road and he did n't want to risk a lot .
The desicion he had to take was n't dificult at all , but because he was a person that hates getting out of the road he knows , and dislikes getting into unknown roads , he took the wrong desicion and it led him to the bankropt .
After that he has changed his behavior a lot .

So , as a conclusion I can say that taking risks is the best way to live this life .

"Recently , I recieved an anonymous , yet very impressive , e-mail power point presentation that made me reflect and musitate on various philosophies of life .
On of these specifically captured my attention : `` To achieve something you have n't met with before , you must do something , well , that you have n't done before . ''
Certainly , successful people do capture fame because they have ventured out into a sea of opportunities rather than stay safely in a boat .

Literature has supported the idea that success arrives after an original challenge has been overcome .
In the epic of Gilgamesh , the hero directs himself to try to gain immortality by traveling to the end of the world .
Though he misplaces the final flower of youth , Gilgamesh acknowledges a sudden sense of completion in his being and a spark of energy to change his kingdom .
Gilgamesh 's goal of gaining immortality does complete itself , as is stated at the end of the epic poem , when his name is recorded in history and remembered throughout subsequent generations .

However , the greatest examples of succes involving risk come to us in history .
Several names pop into my head : Ghandi , Mother Teresa , Martin Luther King , Jr. , Betty Williams , Nelson Mandella ...
All of these people participated and led heroic acts against the standards and conventions of society , against the expectancy of the crowd , and gave us , the present day generations , life , liberty , and justice .
If this fails to ring up the word `` success '' in my ear , I do not know what will .

Finally , personal experiences have rendered this belief of the correlation between risk and succes true .
Two years ago , I decided to try out for my school 's soccer team .
I played midfield , but I settled for goalie just because the team needed one .
This position actually scared me , but , nevertheless , I kept practicing to develop my latent abilties .
Incredibly , I became an all-star goalie .
Even today , I have been invited to compete in the Junior Olympics as a keeper .

All in all , success usually involves some type of risk .
Progress , innovations , and fame all resulted from wild attempts to change .
in this case , `` change '' is the key word .

"Being good at what you do and sticking with it it may take you far , then your abilities and skills may be neede to the job or activitie you may be enhence to performed , but somehow the people who are willing to think outside the box and take risks are the ones that succed .

It often happens in a community , for example in a work place .
there are some people who are escential to the company because of their performance , they are really good at what they do and their performance is exelent , but when it come to the moment of making someone the chief of the department the person that gets it is the one that 's willing to take risks , he thinks outside the box and comes up with new ideas .
Even though the other employe may be more skilled to do the operations , a company needs someone that has inovations and that can bring the company to a higher level .

In history the people that we remember , are those who were took risks and did something out of the ordinary using their abillities and skills .
They were already good artists or maybe good thinkers , like physicians or philosopher , but what made them succed in life is that they tried new things .
An example of this may be Einstein , he tried new thing and by doing so he was able to make amazing discoveries , that still apply to us .

"If we take a look around the world , we will realize that the most successful people have always been at the edge of tecnology and have accomplish their goals by taking risks and trying out new things .
It is necessary just to read any successful man 's biography to understand what this means .

We all need to learn how to do things the best way we can and I think sometimes it can be quite scary to go into an unknown field , because there is a big chance we might fail .
But failure is always a possibility and is present through our whole life and we have to learn to deal with it , because if we all stick to what we do and do n't try out new things , then the world would stop growing and developing and we would be inmerse in a place where there is no innovation .

For instance , in bussiness , the best way to be successful is to come out with some product that nobody else has , that makes you unique .
But most of the time , there is a big chance people wo n't like it .
That 's why even if you do marketing studies , there 's always a risk factor that involves making decissions based on what you believe in without knowing the results .
And in spite of how difficult it looks , it is necessary to keep going and make it happen , just to see how it turns out to be .

In conclusion , the key to success is to innovate and take risks , this is the only way we will be able to build a better world , not only getting money , but also helping society , because in my opinion , success is not only defined by how rich you are , but by how much you have done for the world we live in .

"I agree with the statement because I think that if you only do what you know and even if you are very good at it you will not learn anything new from it .
And I think that to take risks it might not be successful everytime but its a new way to learn .
If you risk and is not successful you should go back and look what you did wrong and learn from those mistakes and how to not ever make them again .
So I look at taking risks as a way of learning somthing new .
If you do n't risk your live will never change and you will do the same thing over and over and if you ever have to be on a situation of taking risks you probably would do n't know what to do , or what to say , or how to react .

Taking a chance to do somthing with your live like liveing in a different country , with a different language , different culture , and a lot of different situations , its to take risk because you dont know how people will act , or you do n't know peoples costumes , or even if you do n't know the language .
But with time and a possitive actitude you will eventually learn about it .
I belive that opportunity is taking risks and opportunity does n't come very often so I think even if you do n't end up been successful after it , I 'm sure you would learn something from it .

I took the opportunity of liveing in another country than were I was born .
And i did n't really know where I was going and how was it going to be .
But with the time I have learned a new language and new culture , a different way to look at the world preaty much .
So I think that I 'm preaty lucky because not a lot of people has done what I have , but I the same time I took a risk and i did n't know if it was going to be succesfull for me .

"I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because when people just focuses on what they have learned from school , and think it is right , they do not open their mind to new experiences wich can not be good for the things they are working on .
For example , when it comes to technology , people must change or improve the ways of doing things really fast , so there can be better development ; without trying new stuff there would not be advance .
Trying new things is important for success because it improves the experience of the person in some facts .

Taking risks is also important for success .
For some people , taking risks might be bad due to the possible negative outcomes their work can get , but taking risks is the only way people can livet new experiences and improve in both working and personal life .
Taking risks is the only way people can prove if what they are doing is right or wrong , if it is right they can keep it , if it is wrong they learned from it and can improve it .

When combining trying with risk , success is more likely to happen , but before really doing something with this two factors people should learn a bit a bout the situation they will work on , this way they can plan better what they will do .
A good example of successful people are leaders , they must always hear and analize the ideas of the people surrounding them .
All those new ideas become things to try that might be positive and improve the work they are doing .
Leaders review the ideas , pick one or combine them , and then try it .
Also , when deciding what to do , they must take risks so the they can really achieve their goals .
Without risking they would not know what to do and just stick to the normal parameters that might not be good for their work .

That is what one of my professors in Spanish Economy in my University in my University used to repeteadly say in class .
He wanted us to be adventured , to have the courage to start up new bussineses and , basically , to take the risk to do something different .
Of course not everybody in class agreed with him , as such way of thinking and living has defenetely pros and cons , but in my oppinion being brave and taking risks in life is important in order to find true happiness and be succesfull .

As previously stated , some of my colleagues in class did not agree at all with the professors idea that taking risks is something necessary .
They advocated that people should only do what they feel comfortable doing and what they are sure they are going to do well .
Therefore , not taking risks would somehow ensure your own happiness or sucess .
It is true , they would argue , that it might not be the higher level of happines that you would be able to reach , but you make sure you are not going to fail in life .
This was infact the particular argument of one of my colleagues , who just wanted to graduate in order to apply for a job in a Public Ministry and work there for the rest of her life .
I thought that it was certainly a safe decission , as she would never have to worry about loosin her job , but in my oppinion she would also renounce to her chances of achieving some higher professional goals .

On the other hand , some other colleagues used to say that taking risks is something very important in life , specially when it comes to the economic sector , in which only those who are brave and not follow the rules are really succesfull and acomplish their goals .
From my perspective , a key allegation to support this argument is the fact that important business leaders around the globe are people who took risks at some point in their lifes , something which gives a lot of food for thought .

In a nutshell , having the courage to take risks is not something easy as of course there is a chance that you might not succeed , but the idea of always doing what is secured and not being able to find and try new things is not atractive to me .

I have always thought that when you do n't take risks you do n't go that far away .

People openminded , who enjoy exploring and trying new things are the ones who take risks , encourage themselves to try uncommon things and see things in another perspective .
This kind of people most of the time find success ; however , some find may it after their death .

I believe that not all humans are destinated to have success , but everybody can try new things .
It just needs determination and hard work .
